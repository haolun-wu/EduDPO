        "question_text": "When recommending movies, Netflix cares about estimating the probability that a user will like a given movie, based on their viewing history. To make this problem tractable, they classify movies into specific genres such as 'Tearjerker' or 'Quirky Romance'. The probability that a Netflix user likes a movie $T_i$ from the 'Tearjerker' genre is given by: Given that they like the Tearjerker genre, $p_i = 0.4$. Given that they do not like the Tearjerker genre, $q_i = 0.9$. 60% of Netflix users like the Tearjerker genre. Netflix assumes that, given a user’s preference for the genre, liking movie $T_i$ and $T_j$ are conditionally independent events for any movies $i$ and $j$.

In this case, we have 5 peer grades for each student (except for the control experiment which has 5 peer grades and one control grade). To find the variance of the mean, we first need to find the variance of the individual grades. Let's assume the five peer grades for a student are `p1, p2, p3, p4, p5`. The variance of these grades is:\n\n`var(p) = (1/n) * sum((p_i - mean(p))^2)`, where `n` is the number of grades (5 in this case) and `p_i` are the individual grades.\n\nThe mean of the grades is `mean(p)`. The mean of the mean grades for all students (except the control experiment) is the average of these means. The variance of this mean is:\n\n`var(mean(p)) = (1/n) * var(mean(p))`, where `n` is the number of students.\n\nSince the variance of a mean is equal to the variance of the data divided by the number of data points, we have:\n\n`var(mean(p)) = (1/n) * (1/n) * var(p)`\n\nSince we don't have the actual data, we cannot compute the exact variance. However, we can say that the variance of the mean of the grades is inversely proportional to the number of students and the variance of the individual grades.\n\nb) Median of Grades:\nThe median of a set of numbers is the middle number when the numbers are sorted in ascending order. In this case, we have 5 peer grades for each student (except for the control experiment which has 6 grades). To find the variance of the median grade, we first need to understand that the median of a set of numbers doesn't change when we add or remove outliers (extreme values), so the variance of the median is 0. However, the control experiment has 6 grades, not 5, so it doesn't have a median in the same sense as the other students. Therefore, the control experiment's score cannot be the median of their grades.\n\nSo, the median of grades cannot be used to assign scores in this case, as it is not applicable to the control experiment. The control experiment's score would be a simple average of their 6 grades, not a median. The variance of the median grade for the other students is 0, as discussed above.\n\nIn summary, the median of grades cannot be used to assign scores, and the variance of the mean of grades is inversely proportional to the number of students and the variance of the individual grades.

Then, permute these six letters in $6!$ ways and group them into pairs. But this overcounts in two ways: (1) by a factor of $3!$ for the ordering of the three pairs, and (2) by a factor of $2^3$ because the ordering within each pair does not matter.

        "ta_solution": "We can solve this problem by thinking about how to define the bounds of a rectangle using lines on the grid, instead of enumerating all possible sizes. A 9x9 grid has 9 rows and 9 columns, but to define rectangles we consider the horizontal and vertical lines that separate these rows and columns. There are 10 horizontal lines (including the boundaries at the top and bottom) and 10 vertical lines (including the left and right boundaries). To define a rectangle, we select two distinct horizontal lines (to serve as the top and bottom bounds) and two distinct vertical lines (to serve as the left and right bounds). The intersection of these chosen bounds gives us a unique rectangle. The number of ways to choose 2 lines from 10 is given by the binomial coefficient: \\[ \\binom{10}{2} = \\frac{10 \\cdot 9}{2} = 45. \\] Therefore, the total number of unique rectangles is the product of the number of choices for the horizontal and vertical bounds: \\[ \\text{Total Rectangles} = \\binom{10}{2} \\times \\binom{10}{2} = 45 \\times 45 = 2025. \\] This approach creatively avoids enumerating individual rectangle sizes and instead uses a combinatorial argument based on choosing boundary lines.",

Since there are 9x9 = 81 squares in the grid, the minimum number of unique rectangles that can be placed is equal to the number of ways we can arrange these 81 squares.\n\nNow, let's consider a 9x9 grid as a collection of 3x3 blocks (since 9 divided by 3 is 3, and there are 3 rows of 3 blocks in the grid). Each 3x3 block contains 9 squares, so there are a total of 9 blocks * 9 squares per block = 81 squares in the grid.\n\nSince the arrangement of these 81 squares within the grid doesn't matter (as long as they all fit), the number of unique rectangles is equivalent to the number of ways we can arrange the 3x3 blocks within the 9x9 grid. This is a permutation problem, where the order matters, but the number of blocks remains the same.\n\nThe number of ways to arrange n items (in this case, 9 blocks) is n! (n factorial). However, since rotating the grid doesn't change the arrangement of the blocks, we need to divide the total number of permutations by 9 (the number of rotations that the 3x3 blocks can have).\n\nSo, the number of unique rectangles that can be placed in the 9x9 grid is 9! / 9 = 9!. This is a very large number (362,880), but it is the number of unique arrangements of the blocks (and thus the unique rectangles) that can fit within the grid.",

You take a course of antibiotics. The probability that bacteria with the mutation survive is 20%. The probability that bacteria without the mutation survive is 1%. What is the probability that a randomly chosen bacterium survives the antibiotics?",

By the Law of Total Probability (LOTP): \\[ P(E) = P(E \\text{ and } M) + P(E \\text{ and } M^C) \\] Applying the Chain Rule: \\[ P(E) = P(E|M)P(M) + P(E|M^C)P(M^C) \\] Substituting the given values: \\[ P(E) = 0.20 \\cdot 0.10 + 0.01 \\cdot 0.90 \\] \\[ P(E) = 0.029 \\] Therefore, the probability that a randomly chosen bacterium survives the antibiotics is 0.029.",
        "stu_solution": "To solve this problem, we need to find the probability of a bacterium surviving the antibiotics, given that it either has the mutation or doesn't have the mutation. Let's denote the number of bacteria with the mutation as M and the number without the mutation as N.\n\nWe know that M + N = 1,000,000 (total population).\n\nThe probability that a bacterium survives the antibiotics given it has the mutation is 20%, so P(survives|mutation) = 0.2.\n\nThe probability that a bacterium survives the antibiotics given it doesn't have the mutation is 1%, so P(survives|no mutation) = 0.01.\n\nSince the events of a bacterium having the mutation and not having the mutation are mutually exclusive (a bacterium either has the mutation or doesn't), we can find the overall probability by multiplying the probability of each event occurring and summing them up:\n\nP(survives) = P(survives|mutation) * P(mutation) + P(survives|no mutation) * P(no mutation)\n\nFirst, we need to find P(mutation) and P(no mutation). Since M + N = 1,000,000, M = 1,000,000 * 0.1 = 100,000. So, N = 1,000,000 - M = 900,000.\n\nP(mutation) = M / (M + N) = 100,000 / 1,000,000 = 0.1\nP(no mutation) = N / (M + N) = 900,000 / 1,000,000 = 0.9\n\nNow, we can calculate P(survives):\n\nP(survives) = 0.2 * 0.1 + 0.01 * 0.9 = 0.02 + 0.009 = 0.029\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly chosen bacterium survives the antibiotics is approximately 2.9%.",

Assume that shot noise photons land on a particular pixel at a rate of 10 photons per microsecond, and the number of photons hitting the pixel follows a Poisson distribution.",
        "ta_solution": "The number of shot noise photons hitting a pixel in a standard photo can be modeled as a Poisson random variable: \\[ X \\sim \\text{Poi}(\\lambda = 10,000) \\] where $\\lambda = 10 \\times 1000 = 10,000$, since the rate is 10 photons per microsecond and the duration is 1000 microseconds. The standard deviation of a Poisson distribution is the square root of its mean: \\[ \\text{Std}(X) = \\sqrt{\\lambda} = \\sqrt{10,000} = 100. \\] Therefore, the standard deviation of the shot noise photons captured in a single standard photo is 100.",
        "stu_solution": "To solve this problem, we need to use the properties of the Poisson distribution. The Poisson distribution is a probability distribution that describes the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space, given a constant average rate or intensity.\n\nThe mean (λ) of a Poisson distribution is the expected number of events in the interval, and the standard deviation (σ) is the square root of the mean.\n\nIn this case, the mean (λ) is the rate at which photons hit the pixel, which is 10 photons per microsecond (10 photons/μs).\n\nThe standard deviation (σ) is then the square root of the mean:\n\nσ = sqrt(λ) = sqrt(10)\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the time duration of the photo shot is 1000 microseconds. Since the rate of photons hitting the pixel is constant, the total number of photons hitting the pixel during the photo shot will be:\n\nTotal number of photons = Rate * Time = 10 photons/μs * 1000 μs = 1000 photons\n\nBut we are asked to find the standard deviation of the number of photons captured by a pixel during a single photo, not the total number of photons. Since the number of photons captured by a pixel during a single photo follows a Poisson distribution, the standard deviation remains the same as the square root of the mean, which we calculated earlier:\n\nStandard deviation of number of photons captured by a pixel = σ = sqrt(λ) = sqrt(10)\n\nSo, the standard deviation of the number of photons captured by a pixel during a single photo is approximately 3.16 photons. This means that about 68% of the time, the number of photons captured by a pixel will be within one standard deviation of the mean (10 ± 3.16 photons), and about 95% of the time, the number of photons captured will be within two standard deviations of the mean (10 ± 6.32 photons).",
        "base_feedback": "Correct, but explanation could be clearer. Emphasize that standard deviation for Poisson is sqrt(mean), not total photons. You correctly identified the mean as 10 photons/μs, but the key insight is that std dev is sqrt(10,000) = 100, not sqrt(10). Clarify that the standard deviation applies to the distribution of photon counts, not the total count over time.",
        "llama_feedback": "Correct. However, you had two main issues: 1. You didn't consider the total time duration of the photo shot (1000 microseconds) in your initial calculation of λ. You correctly calculated λ as 10, not 10,000. 2. You incorrectly stated that the standard deviation remains the same as the square root of the mean, which is not true for the total number of photons captured. The correct standard deviation should be the square root of the total number of photons, which is 100, not the square root of the rate (10).",
        "ta_feedback": "Correct solution approach, but you solved for the wrong λ. Use λ = 10,000 for 1000 μs, not 10. Standard deviation is thus √10,000 = 100 photons.",

First, since we are looking for the probability that at least one block of time is free for both people, we can simplify our calculations by taking the complement of at least one and instead finding one minus the probability that all blocks of time are busy for at least one of the two people.P(1+ time free for both) = 1 - P(all times busy)= 1 - P(block 1 busy ∩ block 2 busy ∩ ... ∩ block 8 busy)= 1 - P(a block is busy for at least one person)^8 We break down the probability of and above by noting that independence between blocks lets us multiply together the probabilities for the individual blocks being busy. Now we have another at least event. At least one person being busy means exactly one person is busy, or both of them are busy. You could use inclusion-exclusion here (probability of or without mutual exclusion, where you need to subtract the intersection), but we could also just take the complement again:= 1 - P(a block is busy for at least one person)^8= 1 - (1 - P(block is free for both people))^8= 1 - (1 - P(person 1 free ∩ person 2 free))^8= 1 - (1 - P(person is free for one block)^2)^8= 1 - (1 - (1 - 0.7)^2)^8.
