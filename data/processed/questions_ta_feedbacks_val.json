        "question_text": "When recommending movies, Netflix cares about estimating the probability that a user will like a given movie, based on their viewing history. To make this problem tractable, they classify movies into specific genres such as 'Tearjerker' or 'Quirky Romance'. The probability that a Netflix user likes a movie $T_i$ from the 'Tearjerker' genre is given by: Given that they like the Tearjerker genre, $p_i = 0.4$. Given that they do not like the Tearjerker genre, $q_i = 0.9$. 60% of Netflix users like the Tearjerker genre. Netflix assumes that, given a user’s preference for the genre, liking movie $T_i$ and $T_j$ are conditionally independent events for any movies $i$ and $j$. What is the probability that they like movies $T_1$, $T_2$, or $T_3$ given that they like the Tearjerker genre?",

        "stu_solution": "To find the probability that a user likes movies T_1, T_2, and T_3 given that they like the Tearjerker genre, we can use the multiplication rule of probability.\n\nLet's denote the event of liking a specific movie as A_i (i.e., A_1 for T_1, A_2 for T_2, and A_3 for T_3).\n\nWe are given the conditional probabilities:\n\n1. Given that they like the Tearjerker genre, the probability of liking a movie (p_i) is 0.37.\n2. Given that they do not like the Tearjerker genre, the probability of liking a movie (q_i) is 0.9.\n\nHowever, we are not given the individual probabilities of liking each movie (P(A_1), P(A_2), P(A_3)) directly. Instead, we are given the probability of liking the Tearjerker genre (0.6).\n\nSince 60% of Netflix users like the Tearjerker genre, that means 40% do not like it. The probability of not liking the Tearjerker genre is then 0.4, and the probability of liking it is 0.6.\n\nSince we are given the conditional probabilities of liking a movie given that they like the Tearjerker genre (p_i = 0.37) and given that they do not like the Tearjerker genre (q_i = 0.9), we can assume that these probabilities are for the users who like the Tearjerker genre (p_i) and for the users who do not like the Tearjerker genre (q_i), respectively.\n\nNow, we can calculate the probability of liking all three movies given that they like the Tearjerker genre:\n\nP(A_1 ∩ A_2 ∩ A_3 | Tearjerker) = P(A_1 | Tearjerker) * P(A_2 | Tearjerker) * P(A_3 | Tearjerker)\n\nHowever, since we don't have the individual probabilities of liking each movie, we cannot directly calculate the probability of liking all three movies. We only have the information about the probabilities of liking a movie given that they like or dislike the Tearjerker genre, but we don't have the individual probabilities of liking each movie.\n\nTherefore, we cannot find the exact probability of liking movies T_1, T_2, and T_3 given that they like the Tearjerker genre without more information.",
        "base_feedback": "Your approach to the problem and understanding of conditional probability given the genre preference is on the right track. However, there is a significant oversight in the application of the provided probabilities. The probabilities \\( p_i = 0. 4 \\) and \\( q_i = 0. 9 \\) are conditional probabilities given the user's preference towards the Tearjerker genre. Specifically, \\( p_i = 0. 4 \\) is the probability that a user likes a movie \\( T_i \\) given that they like the Tearjerker genre, and \\( q_i = 0. 9 \\) is the probability that a user likes a movie \\( T_i \\) given that they do not like the Tearjerker genre. Given that 60% of Netflix users like the Tearjerker genre, this means \\( P(G) = 0. 6 \\) and \\( P(\\neg G) = 0. 4 \\). The mistake in your solution lies in assuming that \\( p_i = 0. 37 \\) and \\( q_i = 0. 9 \\) are the unconditional probabilities of liking a movie, which they are not. These values represent conditional probabilities given the genre preference. To correctly solve this problem, we should use the provided formula and the correct interpretation of the conditional probabilities: \\[ P(L_1 \\text{ or } L_2 \\text{ or } L_3 | G) = P(L_1 | G) + P(L_2 | G) + P(L_3 | G) - P(L_1 | G)P(L_2 | G) - P(L_1 | G)P(L_3 | G) - P(L_2 | G)P(L_3 | G) + P(L_1 | G)P(L_2 | G)P(L_3 | G) \\] Given \\( P(L_i | G) = p_i = 0. 4 \\) and \\( P(L_i | \\neg G) = q_i = 0. 9 \\), and knowing \\( P(G) = 0. 6 \\) and \\( P(\\neg G) = 0. 4 \\), we can substitute these values into the formula. However, since we are asked for the probability given that they like the Tearjerker genre, we should use \\( P(L_i | G) = 0. 4 \\) for all \\( i \\) (movies \\( T_1, T_2, T_3 \\)): \\[ P(L_1 | G \\text{ or } L_2 | G \\text{ or } L_3 | G) = 0. 4 + 0. 4 + 0. 4 - (0. 4 \\times 0. 4) - (0. 4 \\times 0. 4) - (0. 4 \\times 0. 4) + (0. 4 \\times 0. 4 \\times 0. 4) \\] \\[ = 1. 2 - 0. 064 - 0. 064 - 0. 064 + 0. 064 \\] \\[ = 1. 2 - 0. 192 \\] \\[ = 1. 008 \\] This result seems incorrect because probabilities cannot exceed 1.

Your final feedback: You correctly identified the need for conditional probabilities but mistakenly interpreted \\( p_i \\) and \\( q_i \\) as unconditional probabilities. The correct approach involves using the conditional probabilities given the genre preference and applying the inclusion-exclusion principle or directly using the complement rule.

In this case, we have 5 peer grades for each student (except for the control experiment which has 5 peer grades and one control grade). To find the variance of the mean, we first need to find the variance of the individual grades. Let's assume the five peer grades for a student are `p1, p2, p3, p4, p5`. The variance of these grades is:\n\n`var(p) = (1/n) * sum((p_i - mean(p))^2)`, where `n` is the number of grades (5 in this case) and `p_i` are the individual grades.\n\nThe mean of the grades is `mean(p)`. The mean of the mean grades for all students (except the control experiment) is the average of these means.

Let's address them one by one: 1) **No explanation or solving the wrong problem**: For part b, you incorrectly concluded that the variance of the median is 0. The median is not a fixed value and can vary across different samples, thus having its own variance. 2) **Only an equation is provided without explanation**: Your approach in both parts a and b lacks a clear simulation method to estimate the variance, which is crucial for understanding the variability in peer-assigned grades. 3) **Major error in probability theory**: You misunderstood the concept of the variance of the median. The median does vary across different samples and hence has a non-zero variance. ### Corrective Guidance For part a, you correctly identified the formula for the variance of the mean. However, you did not simulate the sampling process to estimate the variance of the mean of the grades. Here’s how you could do it: ```python import numpy as np # Assuming 'grades' is loaded from the CSV file means = [] for _ in range(10000): # Repeat the sampling process many times sample = np. random. choice(grades, 5, replace=True) # Sample 5 grades with replacement means. append(np. mean(sample)) # Calculate the mean of the sample variance_of_mean = np. var(means) # Estimate the variance of the mean ``` For part b, the median is indeed more robust to outliers compared to the mean, but it still varies across different samples. To estimate the variance of the median, you can follow a similar approach: ```python medians = [] for _ in range(10000): # Repeat the sampling process many times sample = np. random. choice(grades, 5, replace=True) # Sample 5 grades with replacement medians. append(np. median(sample)) # Calculate the median of the sample variance_of_median = np. var(medians) # Estimate the variance of the median ``` ### Conclusion You should implement these simulations to accurately estimate the variances. This will help you compare the stability of the mean versus the median as scoring methods for peer assessments. Remember, the median is less affected by outliers, making it potentially more stable in practice.",

        "ta_solution": "We can solve this problem by thinking about how to define the bounds of a rectangle using lines on the grid, instead of enumerating all possible sizes. A 9x9 grid has 9 rows and 9 columns, but to define rectangles we consider the horizontal and vertical lines that separate these rows and columns. There are 10 horizontal lines (including the boundaries at the top and bottom) and 10 vertical lines (including the left and right boundaries). To define a rectangle, we select two distinct horizontal lines (to serve as the top and bottom bounds) and two distinct vertical lines (to serve as the left and right bounds). The intersection of these chosen bounds gives us a unique rectangle. The number of ways to choose 2 lines from 10 is given by the binomial coefficient: \\[ \\binom{10}{2} = \\frac{10 \\cdot 9}{2} = 45. \\] Therefore, the total number of unique rectangles is the product of the number of choices for the horizontal and vertical bounds: \\[ \\text{Total Rectangles} = \\binom{10}{2} \\times \\binom{10}{2} = 45 \\times 45 = 2025. \\] This approach creatively avoids enumerating individual rectangle sizes and instead uses a combinatorial argument based on choosing boundary lines.",
        "stu_solution": "To solve this problem creatively, let's approach it by considering the smallest possible rectangle that can be placed within the 9x9 grid, which is a 1x1 square. Since there are 9x9 = 81 squares in the grid, the minimum number of unique rectangles that can be placed is equal to the number of ways we can arrange these 81 squares.\n\nNow, let's consider a 9x9 grid as a collection of 3x3 blocks (since 9 divided by 3 is 3, and there are 3 rows of 3 blocks in the grid). Each 3x3 block contains 9 squares, so there are a total of 9 blocks * 9 squares per block = 81 squares in the grid.\n\nSince the arrangement of these 81 squares within the grid doesn't matter (as long as they all fit), the number of unique rectangles is equivalent to the number of ways we can arrange the 3x3 blocks within the 9x9 grid. This is a permutation problem, where the order matters, but the number of blocks remains the same.\n\nThe number of ways to arrange n items (in this case, 9 blocks) is n! (n factorial). However, since rotating the grid doesn't change the arrangement of the blocks, we need to divide the total number of permutations by 9 (the number of rotations that the 3x3 blocks can have).\n\nSo, the number of unique rectangles that can be placed in the 9x9 grid is 9! / 9 = 9!.

However, there are a few key issues with your solution: 1. **Misinterpretation of the Problem**: The problem asks for the number of unique rectangles that can fit within a 9x9 grid, not the number of unique ways to arrange 3x3 blocks. Your solution incorrectly equates the arrangement of blocks to the number of rectangles. 2. **Incorrect Application of Permutations**: You've applied the concept of permutations (9! ) to the arrangement of blocks, but this doesn't correctly address the definition of a rectangle. A rectangle is defined by its four corners, and the problem requires counting all possible such configurations, not just block arrangements. 3. **Equating Squares to Rectangles**: Your solution suggests that the number of rectangles is equivalent to the number of ways to arrange 81 squares, which is a misunderstanding. Rectangles are defined by their boundaries, not by the individual squares they contain. **Corrective Guidance**: To correctly solve this problem, consider the combinatorial approach provided in the teacher's solution. Instead of focusing on blocks or individual squares, think about how to define a rectangle using lines. Specifically, consider the intersection points of horizontal and vertical lines that divide the grid into smaller regions. This approach allows you to count rectangles without enumerating individual squares or block arrangements.

The Poisson distribution is a probability distribution that describes the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space, given a constant average rate or intensity.\n\nThe mean (λ) of a Poisson distribution is the expected number of events in the interval, and the standard deviation (σ) is the square root of the mean.\n\nIn this case, the mean (λ) is the rate at which photons hit the pixel, which is 10 photons per microsecond (10 photons/μs).\n\nThe standard deviation (σ) is then the square root of the mean:\n\nσ = sqrt(λ) = sqrt(10)\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the time duration of the photo shot is 1000 microseconds. Since the rate of photons hitting the pixel is constant, the total number of photons hitting the pixel during the photo shot will be:\n\nTotal number of photons = Rate * Time = 10 photons/μs * 1000 μs = 1000 photons\n\nBut we are asked to find the standard deviation of the number of photons captured by a pixel during a single photo, not the total number of photons. Since the number of photons captured by a pixel during a single photo follows a Poisson distribution, the standard deviation remains the same as the square root of the mean, which we calculated earlier:\n\nStandard deviation of number of photons captured by a pixel = σ = sqrt(λ) = sqrt(10)\n\nSo, the standard deviation of the number of photons captured by a pixel during a single photo is approximately 3.16 photons. This means that about 68% of the time, the number of photons captured by a pixel will be within one standard deviation of the mean (10 ± 3.16 photons), and about 95% of the time, the number of photons captured will be within two standard deviations of the mean (10 ± 6.32 photons).",
        "base_feedback": "Your solution correctly identifies the use of the Poisson distribution to model the number of photons hitting a pixel during a photo shot and accurately states that the standard deviation is the square root of the mean. However, there is a significant error in your calculation of the total number of photons and subsequently the mean (λ) for the Poisson distribution. You correctly calculate the rate of photons per microsecond (10 photons/μs) and the duration of the photo shot (1000 μs), resulting in a total expected number of photons (1000 photons). However, when calculating the mean (λ) for the Poisson distribution, you should use the rate per unit time directly without multiplying by the time duration. The mean λ should be 10 (photons per microsecond) because this is the average rate at which photons hit the pixel per unit time. Thus, the correct mean (λ) for the Poisson distribution is 10, not 10,000. Consequently, the standard deviation (σ) is the square root of this mean: \\[ \\text{Std}(X) = \\sqrt{\\lambda} = \\sqrt{10} \\approx 3. 16 \\] Your final answer is correct, but the explanation leading to it contains a major error in probability theory regarding the calculation of the mean for the Poisson distribution. The mean λ should represent the average number of events (photons, in this case) per unit time, not the total number of events over the entire duration. This misunderstanding is a rare but significant error in probability theory. Corrected Feedback: Your solution correctly identifies the use of the Poisson distribution and correctly states that the standard deviation is the square root of the mean. However, the mean (λ) for the Poisson distribution should be 10 (photons per microsecond), not 10,000, as the rate is 10 photons per microsecond and the time duration is already factored into the rate itself. The standard deviation is therefore \\(\\sqrt{10} \\approx 3. 16\\), which you correctly calculated. Remember, for a Poisson distribution, the mean λ represents the average rate per unit time, not the total number of events over the entire duration.",

You should provide a clear and concise explanation of your thought process and the reasoning behind your calculations. 2. **Incorrect calculation**: You calculate the mean (λ) as 10 photons per microsecond, but then you multiply it by the time duration (1000 microseconds) to get the total number of photons. However, this is not necessary to find the standard deviation. The mean of the Poisson distribution is already given by the rate (λ) times the time duration, which is 10,000 photons. You correctly calculate the standard deviation as the square root of the mean, but then you incorrectly state that it's the square root of 10, which is a major error in probability theory. 3. **Misapplication of Poisson distribution**: You correctly identify that the number of photons captured by a pixel during a single photo follows a Poisson distribution, but then you incorrectly state that the standard deviation remains the same as the square root of the mean, which is 10. As you correctly calculated earlier, the mean is 10,000, so the standard deviation should be the square root of 10,000, not 10. Corrective guidance: * Start by explaining the properties of the Poisson distribution and how they apply to the problem. * Clearly state the mean (λ) of the Poisson distribution, which is the rate (10 photons per microsecond) times the time duration (1000 microseconds), resulting in 10,000 photons. * Correctly calculate the standard deviation as the square root of the mean, which is the square root of 10,000. * Make sure to apply the Poisson distribution correctly and avoid misapplying its properties.",
        "ta_feedback": "Your work shows a good understanding of the Poisson distribution and how to calculate the standard deviation from the mean. However, there's a critical mistake in your calculation of the mean (λ). The mean should account for both the rate of photons and the duration of the photo shot, which you initially overlooked. Here’s the correction: The rate of photons hitting the pixel is 10 photons per microsecond, and the duration of the photo shot is 1000 microseconds. Thus, the mean (λ) is: \\[ \\lambda = 10 \\times 1000 = 10,000 \\] Consequently, the standard deviation (σ) is: \\[ \\sigma = \\sqrt{\\lambda} = \\sqrt{10,000} = 100 \\] Therefore, the standard deviation of the number of photons captured by a pixel during a single photo is 100 photons.",

First, since we are looking for the probability that at least one block of time is free for both people, we can simplify our calculations by taking the complement of at least one and instead finding one minus the probability that all blocks of time are busy for at least one of the two people.P(1+ time free for both) = 1 - P(all times busy)= 1 - P(block 1 busy ∩ block 2 busy ∩ ... ∩ block 8 busy)= 1 - P(a block is busy for at least one person)^8 We break down the probability of and above by noting that independence between blocks lets us multiply together the probabilities for the individual blocks being busy. Now we have another at least event. At least one person being busy means exactly one person is busy, or both of them are busy. You could use inclusion-exclusion here (probability of or without mutual exclusion, where you need to subtract the intersection), but we could also just take the complement again:= 1 - P(a block is busy for at least one person)^8= 1 - (1 - P(block is free for both people))^8= 1 - (1 - P(person 1 free ∩ person 2 free))^8= 1 - (1 - P(person is free for one block)^2)^8= 1 - (1 - (1 - 0.7)^2)^8.
