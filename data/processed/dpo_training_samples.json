If you choose two shapes with replacement, what is the probability that the two shapes are the same? Note that it is possible to get two triangles: after you pick the first triangle, you put it back into the set of shapes and it can be chosen again. Teacher solution: The sample space consists of 49 possible outcomes because there are 7 choices for the first shape and 7 choices for the second shape (since selection is with replacement). \\[ |S| = 7 \\times 7 = 49 \\] Let $E$ be the event where the two shapes are the same. There are two ways this can happen: (1) both shapes are squares, or (2) both shapes are triangles. Define $A$ as the event of selecting two squares, and $B$ as the event of selecting two triangles. These two events are mutually exclusive. The number of ways to choose two squares is \\[ |A| = 6 \\times 6 = 36 \\] since there are 6 squares and we choose one twice (with replacement). The number of ways to choose two triangles is \\[ |B| = 1 \\times 1 = 1 \\] since there is only one triangle. Therefore, the probability of selecting two matching shapes is \\[ P(\\text{same}) = \\frac{|E|}{|S|} = \\frac{|A| + |B|}{|S|} = \\frac{36 + 1}{49} = \\frac{37}{49}. \\] The Student's Work: In this problem, we have six squares, and since the shapes can be chosen more than once, we're essentially asking for the probability of getting the same outcome on two independent trials with replacement.

Since the trials are independent and with replacement, the probability of picking the same square in both trials is the product of the probabilities of picking the square in each trial.

Information you'll need: Question: How many unique rectangles can you fit in a 9x9 grid? Rectangles can be any size as long as they fit within the grid. Please provide a creative solution rather than brute forcing over sizes. Teacher solution: We can solve this problem by thinking about how to define the bounds of a rectangle using lines on the grid, instead of enumerating all possible sizes. A 9x9 grid has 9 rows and 9 columns, but to define rectangles we consider the horizontal and vertical lines that separate these rows and columns. There are 10 horizontal lines (including the boundaries at the top and bottom) and 10 vertical lines (including the left and right boundaries). To define a rectangle, we select two distinct horizontal lines (to serve as the top and bottom bounds) and two distinct vertical lines (to serve as the left and right bounds). The intersection of these chosen bounds gives us a unique rectangle. The number of ways to choose 2 lines from 10 is given by the binomial coefficient: \\[ \\binom{10}{2} = \\frac{10 \\cdot 9}{2} = 45. \\] Therefore, the total number of unique rectangles is the product of the number of choices for the horizontal and vertical bounds: \\[ \\text{Total Rectangles} = \\binom{10}{2} \\times \\binom{10}{2} = 45 \\times 45 = 2025. \\] This approach creatively avoids enumerating individual rectangle sizes and instead uses a combinatorial argument based on choosing boundary lines. The Student's Work: To find the number of unique rectangles that can fit in a 9x9 grid without brute-forcing over sizes, we can use a combinatorial approach. This problem involves placing a rectangle with width 'w' and height 'h' (where both are positive integers and w <= h) within the 9x9 grid. The number of ways to place a rectangle with width w and height h in a 9x9 grid is given by the number of pairs of integers (x, y) such that: 1. x + w <= 9 2. y + h <= 9 3. x, y, w, h are all non-negative integers Since the rectangle can be rotated 90 degrees, we also need to consider the cases where w and h are interchanged. So, we have two cases: Case 1: w <= h Number of ways = Sum of the number of pairs (x, y) that satisfy the above conditions for w and h. Case 2: h <= w Number of ways = Sum of the number of pairs (x, y) that satisfy the above conditions for h and w. Now, let's analyze the number of ways for Case 1. For a given w, the number of ways for y is simply y (since y can range from 0 to (9 - w)). For each y, the number of x values is (9 - w - y + 1) as x can range from 0 to (9 - w - y). So, the total number of ways for a given w is: Total_ways_1(w) = Sum from y = 0 to min(w, 9) of (9 - w - y + 1) Similarly, for Case 2: Total_ways_2(h) = Sum from w = 0 to min(h, 9) of (9 - h - w + 1) Now, to find the total number of unique rectangles, we need to sum Total_ways_1(w) and Total_ways_2(h) for all possible w and h such that w <= h and both are less than or equal to 9. However, since the grid is symmetric, we only need to consider the cases where w and h are less than or equal to 4, as the remaining cases will be covered by rotating the smaller rectangle. So, the total number of unique rectangles that can fit in a 9x9 grid is: Total_rectangles = Sum from w = 1 to 4 of Total_ways_1(w) + Sum from h = 1 to min(4, w) of Total_ways_2(h) This approach provides a creative solution to the problem by considering the symmetry of the grid and using combinatorial reasoning to find the number of unique rectangles.",

Information you'll need: Question: Program A will run 20 algorithms in sequence, with the running time for each algorithm being independent random variables with mean = 50 seconds and variance = 100 seconds$^2$. Program B will run 20 algorithms in sequence, with the running time for each algorithm being independent random variables with mean = 52 seconds and variance = 200 seconds$^2$. What is the approximate probability that Program A completes in less time than B? Give an answer to three decimal places. Teacher solution: Let $X_A$ be the running time of program A, and $X_B$ be the running time of program B. Using the Central Limit Theorem, we can find the distributions of $X_A$ and $X_B$: \\[ X_A \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu = 20 \\cdot 50,\\ \\sigma^2 = 20 \\cdot 100) \\] \\[ X_B \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu = 20 \\cdot 52,\\ \\sigma^2 = 20 \\cdot 200) \\] Define a new random variable $X_{A-B}$, representing the difference in running times between program A and program B. Since the sum or difference between two normal random variables is also normal: \\[ X_{A-B} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu = 1000 - 1040,\\ \\sigma^2 = 2000 + 4000) \\] \\[ X_{A-B} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(-40,\\ 6000) \\] Note that we subtract the means, but add the variances. This is because subtracting the two normals is the same as transforming $X_B$ into $(-1) \\cdot X_B$, then adding that to $X_A$. If program A finishes in less time than program B, then $X_{A-B} < 0$. We can calculate the probability of this as: \\[ P(X_{A-B} < 0) = \\Phi\\left( \\frac{0 - (-40)}{\\sqrt{6000}} \\right) = \\Phi(0. 516) \\approx 0. 697 \\] The Student's Work: To solve this problem, we'll use the concept of the expected value and standard deviation of a sum of independent random variables, and then compare the cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) of the two distributions. 1. First, let's calculate the expected running time for each program. The expected value (mean) of a normally distributed random variable is equal to the sum of the means of its independent components. So, for Program A, the expected running time is 20 * 50 = 1000 seconds (approximately 166. 67 minutes). For Program B, the expected running time is 20 * 59 = 1180 seconds (approximately 19. 67 minutes). 2. Next, we'll calculate the standard deviation of the total running time for each program. The standard deviation of the sum of independent random variables is the square root of the sum of the squares of their individual standard deviations. For Program A, the standard deviation is sqrt(20 * 100) = 10 * sqrt(2) â‰ˆ 14. 14 seconds. For Program B, the standard deviation is sqrt(20 * 200) = 20 * sqrt(5) â‰ˆ 35. 36 seconds. 3. Now, we can approximate the probability that Program A completes in less time than B by comparing the CDFs of their respective normal distributions. Since the normal distribution is symmetric around its mean, we can compare the means directly. The z-score for Program A is (1000 - 1180) / ((14. 14 + 35. 36) / 2) â‰ˆ -5. 13. Using a z-table or a calculator with a normal distribution function, we find that the CDF of the standard normal distribution at z = -5. 13 is approximately 0. 0000023 (three decimal places). 4. Since the CDF gives the probability that a random variable is less than or equal to a certain value, we can subtract this value from 1 to get the probability that the random variable is greater than that value. So, the approximate probability that Program A completes in less time than B is 1 - 0. 0000023 â‰ˆ 0. 9999977 (three decimal places).",

Information you'll need: Question: Program A will run 20 algorithms in sequence, with the running time for each algorithm being independent random variables with mean = 50 seconds and variance = 100 seconds$^2$. Program B will run 20 algorithms in sequence, with the running time for each algorithm being independent random variables with mean = 52 seconds and variance = 200 seconds$^2$. What is the approximate probability that Program A completes in less time than B? Give an answer to three decimal places. Teacher solution: Let $X_A$ be the running time of program A, and $X_B$ be the running time of program B. Using the Central Limit Theorem, we can find the distributions of $X_A$ and $X_B$: \\[ X_A \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu = 20 \\cdot 50,\\ \\sigma^2 = 20 \\cdot 100) \\] \\[ X_B \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu = 20 \\cdot 52,\\ \\sigma^2 = 20 \\cdot 200) \\] Define a new random variable $X_{A-B}$, representing the difference in running times between program A and program B. Since the sum or difference between two normal random variables is also normal: \\[ X_{A-B} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu = 1000 - 1040,\\ \\sigma^2 = 2000 + 4000) \\] \\[ X_{A-B} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(-40,\\ 6000) \\] Note that we subtract the means, but add the variances. This is because subtracting the two normals is the same as transforming $X_B$ into $(-1) \\cdot X_B$, then adding that to $X_A$. If program A finishes in less time than program B, then $X_{A-B} < 0$. We can calculate the probability of this as: \\[ P(X_{A-B} < 0) = \\Phi\\left( \\frac{0 - (-40)}{\\sqrt{6000}} \\right) = \\Phi(0. 516) \\approx 0. 697 \\] The Student's Work: To solve this problem, we'll use the concept of the expected value and standard deviation of a sum of independent random variables, and then compare the cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) of the two distributions. 1. First, let's calculate the expected running time for each program. The expected value (mean) of a normally distributed random variable is equal to the sum of the means of its independent components. So, for Program A, the expected running time is 20 * 50 = 1000 seconds (approximately 166. 67 minutes). For Program B, the expected running time is 20 * 59 = 1180 seconds (approximately 19. 67 minutes). 2. Next, we'll calculate the standard deviation of the total running time for each program. The standard deviation of the sum of independent random variables is the square root of the sum of the squares of their individual standard deviations. For Program A, the standard deviation is sqrt(20 * 100) = 10 * sqrt(2) â‰ˆ 14. 14 seconds. For Program B, the standard deviation is sqrt(20 * 200) = 20 * sqrt(5) â‰ˆ 35. 36 seconds. 3. Now, we can approximate the probability that Program A completes in less time than B by comparing the CDFs of their respective normal distributions. Since the normal distribution is symmetric around its mean, we can compare the means directly. The z-score for Program A is (1000 - 1180) / ((14. 14 + 35. 36) / 2) â‰ˆ -5. 13. Using a z-table or a calculator with a normal distribution function, we find that the CDF of the standard normal distribution at z = -5. 13 is approximately 0. 0000023 (three decimal places). 4. Since the CDF gives the probability that a random variable is less than or equal to a certain value, we can subtract this value from 1 to get the probability that the random variable is greater than that value. So, the approximate probability that Program A completes in less time than B is 1 - 0. 0000023 â‰ˆ 0. 9999977 (three decimal places).",

Information you'll need: Question: When recommending movies, Netflix cares about estimating the probability that a user will like a given movie, based on their viewing history. To make this problem tractable, they classify movies into specific genres such as 'Tearjerker' or 'Quirky Romance'. The probability that a Netflix user likes a movie $T_i$ from the 'Tearjerker' genre is given by: Given that they like the Tearjerker genre, $p_i = 0. 4$. Given that they do not like the Tearjerker genre, $q_i = 0. 9$. 60% of Netflix users like the Tearjerker genre. Netflix assumes that, given a userâ€™s preference for the genre, liking movie $T_i$ and $T_j$ are conditionally independent events for any movies $i$ and $j$. What is the probability that they like movies $T_1$, $T_2$, or $T_3$ given that they like the Tearjerker genre? Teacher solution: Let $L_i | G$ be the event that they like movie $T_i$ given that they like the Tearjerker genre. The probability that they like at least one of the movies $T_1$, $T_2$, or $T_3$ given that they like the genre is: \\[ \\text{Answer} = P(L_1 | G \\text{ or } L_2 | G \\text{ or } L_3 | G) \\] Using the complement rule: \\[ = 1 - P(L_1^C | G \\text{ and } L_2^C | G \\text{ and } L_3^C | G) \\] Since the events are conditionally independent: \\[ = 1 - (1 - p_1)(1 - p_2)(1 - p_3) \\] An alternative approach uses the inclusion/exclusion principle: \\[ P(L_1 | G \\text{ or } L_2 | G \\text{ or } L_3 | G) = p_1 + p_2 + p_3 - (p_1 p_2) - (p_1 p_3) - (p_2 p_3) + (p_1 p_2 p_3). \\] The Student's Work: To solve this problem, we will use the Bayes' theorem for conditional probabilities. Bayes' theorem states that for two events A and B, the probability of A given B (P(A|B)) can be found by multiplying the probability of B given A (P(B|A)) by the prior probability of A (P(A)) and dividing by the probability of B (P(B)). In this case, we have three movies, $T_1$, $T_2$, and $T_3$ from the 'Tearjerker' genre. We want to determine whether they are conditionally independent given that a user likes the Tearjerker genre. First, let's find the probabilities mentioned in the problem: 1. Probability of liking a Tearjerker movie given that they like the Tearjerker genre: P(T_i | Like Tearjerker) = p_i = 0. 47 2. Probability of not liking a Tearjerker movie given that they like the Tearjerker genre: P(Not T_i | Like Tearjerker) = 1 - P(T_i | Like Tearjerker) = 1 - 0. 47 = 0. 53 3. Probability of liking a Tearjerker movie given that they do not like the Tearjerker genre: P(T_i | Not Like Tearjerker) = q_i = 0. 9 4. Probability of not liking a Tearjerker movie given that they do not like the Tearjerker genre: P(Not T_i | Not Like Tearjerker) = 1 - P(T_i | Not Like Tearjerker) = 1 - 0. 9 = 0. 1 5. Prior probability of liking the Tearjerker genre: P(Like Tearjerker) = 0. 6 Now, let's find the joint probability of liking two or more Tearjerker movies, which will help us determine if they are conditionally independent: P(Like Tearjerker and Like Tearjerker_2) = P(Like Tearjerker) * P(Like Tearjerker_2 | Like Tearjerker) P(Like Tearjerker and Like Tearjerker_3) = P(Like Tearjerker) * P(Like Tearjerker_3 | Like Tearjerker) P(Like Tearjerker, Like Tearjerker_2, Like Tearjerker_3) = P(Like Tearjerker) * P(Like Tearjerker_2 | Like Tearjerker) * P(Like Tearjerker_3 | Like Tearjerker) Since the movies are conditionally independent, the joint probability of liking all three movies should be the product of the individual probabilities: P(Like Tearjerker, Like Tearjerker_2, Like Tearjerker_3) = P(Like Tearjerker) * P(Like Tearjerker_2 | Like Tearjerker) * P(Like Tearjerker_3 | Like Tearjerker) If the calculated joint probability is approximately equal to the joint probability found using the Bayes' theorem, then the movies are conditionally independent.

Since we have 20 algorithms running in each program, we can approximate the difference in their running times as a normally distributed random variable. 5.

Each block has $p = 0. 7$ probability of being busy for each person. We assume that whether each block is busy for a person is independent of whether other blocks are busy for them, and also independent of whether that block is busy for other people. Question: Two people are trying to schedule a meeting. What is the probability that there is at least one block of time when they are both free on a given day? Provide an answer to 3 decimal places. Teacher solution: Solving this problem requires us to recognize how helpful it is to take the complement a few times. First, since we are looking for the probability that at least one block of time is free for both people, we can simplify our calculations by taking the complement of at least one and instead finding one minus the probability that all blocks of time are busy for at least one of the two people. P(1+ time free for both) = 1 - P(all times busy)= 1 - P(block 1 busy âˆ© block 2 busy âˆ© . . . âˆ© block 8 busy)= 1 - P(a block is busy for at least one person)^8 We break down the probability of and above by noting that independence between blocks lets us multiply together the probabilities for the individual blocks being busy. Now we have another at least event. At least one person being busy means exactly one person is busy, or both of them are busy. You could use inclusion-exclusion here (probability of or without mutual exclusion, where you need to subtract the intersection), but we could also just take the complement again:= 1 - P(a block is busy for at least one person)^8= 1 - (1 - P(block is free for both people))^8= 1 - (1 - P(person 1 free âˆ© person 2 free))^8= 1 - (1 - P(person is free for one block)^2)^8= 1 - (1 - (1 - 0. 7)^2)^8.

The Student's Work: To solve this problem, we will use the complementary probability method. Instead of finding the probability that both people are free at the same time, we will find the probability that they are both busy at the same time and then subtract that from 1. Let's denote the probability of a person being free as q = 1 - p = 1 - 0. 80 = 0. 20. The probability that both people are busy at the same time in a single block is (0. 80)^2 = 0. 64.

Information you'll need: Question: If the time duration of a photo shot is 1000 microseconds (Î¼s), what is the standard deviation of the number of photons captured by a pixel during a single photo? Assume that shot noise photons land on a particular pixel at a rate of 10 photons per microsecond, and the number of photons hitting the pixel follows a Poisson distribution. Teacher solution: The number of shot noise photons hitting a pixel in a standard photo can be modeled as a Poisson random variable: \\[ X \\sim \\text{Poi}(\\lambda = 10,000) \\] where $\\lambda = 10 \\times 1000 = 10,000$, since the rate is 10 photons per microsecond and the duration is 1000 microseconds. The standard deviation of a Poisson distribution is the square root of its mean: \\[ \\text{Std}(X) = \\sqrt{\\lambda} = \\sqrt{10,000} = 100. \\] Therefore, the standard deviation of the shot noise photons captured in a single standard photo is 100. The Student's Work: To find the standard deviation of the number of photons captured by a pixel during a single photo, we can use the property of the Poisson distribution, which is that the standard deviation (Ïƒ) is equal to the square root of the mean (Î¼) for this distribution. Given that the mean number of photons hitting the pixel per microsecond is 10 photons (Î¼ = 10), the standard deviation Ïƒ will be the square root of 10, which is approximately 3. 1622776601683795 (rounded to 7 decimal places). So, the standard deviation of the number of photons captured by a pixel during a single 1000 Î¼s photo shot is approximately 3. 16 photons. This value represents the average deviation of the actual number of photons captured from the mean number of photons captured per microsecond (10 photons) over the entire 1000 Î¼s photo shot.",

The Student's Work: To solve this problem, we need to understand the Poisson distribution and how it applies to the number of photons hitting a pixel. The Poisson distribution is a probabilistic model that describes the number of events occurring within a given time or space interval, given a known average rate. In this case, the \"events\" are the photons hitting the pixel, and the \"average rate\" is the rate at which photons are expected to arrive per unit time. Since the time duration of a photo shot is 1000 microseconds (1 ms), and we're given no specific information about the average rate of photons, we can't directly calculate the parameters of the Poisson distribution. However, we can still use the Poisson distribution to find probabilities or expected values if we know the average rate of photons. If we knew the average number of photons arriving per microsecond (Î»), we could calculate the probability of a specific number of photons arriving during the 1000 microseconds as follows: P(X = k) = (e^(-Î») * Î»^k) / k! Where: - P(X = k) is the probability of k photons arriving in the 1000 microseconds - e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2. 71828) - Î» is the average number of photons arriving per microsecond - k is the number of photons we're interested in (e. g. , k = 1000 for the total number of photons in 1 ms) - ! denotes the factorial function (e. g. , 5! = 5*4*3*2*1 = 120) To find the expected value (mean) of the number of photons arriving in 1 ms, we would use the formula: E(X) = Î» So, if we knew Î», we could calculate the expected number of photons arriving in 1 ms and the probabilities of different numbers of photons arriving.

Each block has $p = 0. 7$ probability of being busy for each person. We assume that whether each block is busy for a person is independent of whether other blocks are busy for them, and also independent of whether that block is busy for other people. Question: Two people are trying to schedule a meeting. What is the probability that there is at least one block of time when they are both free on a given day? Provide an answer to 3 decimal places. Teacher solution: Solving this problem requires us to recognize how helpful it is to take the complement a few times. First, since we are looking for the probability that at least one block of time is free for both people, we can simplify our calculations by taking the complement of at least one and instead finding one minus the probability that all blocks of time are busy for at least one of the two people. P(1+ time free for both) = 1 - P(all times busy)= 1 - P(block 1 busy âˆ© block 2 busy âˆ© . . . âˆ© block 8 busy)= 1 - P(a block is busy for at least one person)^8 We break down the probability of and above by noting that independence between blocks lets us multiply together the probabilities for the individual blocks being busy. Now we have another at least event. At least one person being busy means exactly one person is busy, or both of them are busy. You could use inclusion-exclusion here (probability of or without mutual exclusion, where you need to subtract the intersection), but we could also just take the complement again:= 1 - P(a block is busy for at least one person)^8= 1 - (1 - P(block is free for both people))^8= 1 - (1 - P(person 1 free âˆ© person 2 free))^8= 1 - (1 - P(person is free for one block)^2)^8= 1 - (1 - (1 - 0. 7)^2)^8. Above, we used independence between people to break down a probability of and into the product of the probability that one person is free for a particular block, and finally, we plugged in the complement of the probability that a person is busy for one block. The Student's Work: To solve this problem, we will use the complementary probability method.

Let A and B be the events that person A and person B are busy in a given block, respectively.

Assume that shot noise photons land on a particular pixel at a rate of 10 photons per microsecond, and the number of photons hitting the pixel follows a Poisson distribution. Teacher solution: The number of shot noise photons hitting a pixel in a standard photo can be modeled as a Poisson random variable: \\[ X \\sim \\text{Poi}(\\lambda = 10,000) \\] where $\\lambda = 10 \\times 1000 = 10,000$, since the rate is 10 photons per microsecond and the duration is 1000 microseconds.

Note that it is possible to get two triangles: after you pick the first triangle, you put it back into the set of shapes and it can be chosen again.

There are two ways this can happen: (1) both shapes are squares, or (2) both shapes are triangles. Define $A$ as the event of selecting two squares, and $B$ as the event of selecting two triangles. These two events are mutually exclusive. The number of ways to choose two squares is \\[ |A| = 6 \\times 6 = 36 \\] since there are 6 squares and we choose one twice (with replacement). The number of ways to choose two triangles is \\[ |B| = 1 \\times 1 = 1 \\] since there is only one triangle.

If we have a set of n distinct shapes (let's say n=3 for simplicity) and we draw one shape, say shape A, and then put it back into the set before drawing again, the probability of drawing shape A again in the second draw is 1/3, since there are now 4 shapes in the set (3 original shapes + 1 returned shape). If we want to find the probability of drawing shape A in the first draw and then drawing a different shape (not shape A) in the second draw, we can calculate it as follows: 1. The probability of drawing shape A in the first draw is 1/3. 2. After drawing shape A, there are 2 other shapes left in the set (not counting shape A). The probability of drawing one of these two shapes in the second draw is 2/3 (since there are 3 total shapes left). 3. So, the probability of drawing shape A in the first draw and a different shape in the second draw is (1/3) * (2/3) = 2/9. If we want to generalize this to a set of n shapes where we draw k shapes without replacement, the formula for the probability of drawing a specific sequence of k shapes would be: P(S1, S2, . . . , Sk) = (1/n) * (1 - 1/n) * (1 - 2/n) * . . . * (1 - (k-1)/n) Where S1, S2, . . . , Sk are the specific shapes drawn in the first, second, . . . , k-th draws, and n is the total number of shapes in the set.

Please provide a creative solution rather than brute forcing over sizes. Teacher solution: We can solve this problem by thinking about how to define the bounds of a rectangle using lines on the grid, instead of enumerating all possible sizes. A 9x9 grid has 9 rows and 9 columns, but to define rectangles we consider the horizontal and vertical lines that separate these rows and columns. There are 10 horizontal lines (including the boundaries at the top and bottom) and 10 vertical lines (including the left and right boundaries). To define a rectangle, we select two distinct horizontal lines (to serve as the top and bottom bounds) and two distinct vertical lines (to serve as the left and right bounds). The intersection of these chosen bounds gives us a unique rectangle. The number of ways to choose 2 lines from 10 is given by the binomial coefficient: \\[ \\binom{10}{2} = \\frac{10 \\cdot 9}{2} = 45. \\] Therefore, the total number of unique rectangles is the product of the number of choices for the horizontal and vertical bounds: \\[ \\text{Total Rectangles} = \\binom{10}{2} \\times \\binom{10}{2} = 45 \\times 45 = 2025. \\] This approach creatively avoids enumerating individual rectangle sizes and instead uses a combinatorial argument based on choosing boundary lines. The Student's Work: To approach this problem creatively, let's consider the number of ways we can place a single cell (1x1 square) in the 10x9 grid. Since a cell can be placed in any of the 10*9 positions, we have 10*9 = 90 ways to place the first cell. Now, each time we place a cell, we effectively reduce the available space for the next cell(s) by 1 square unit. So, to place the second cell, we have 9 available spots where it can be placed, but each of those spots has 8 adjacent free spots for subsequent cells. This means we have 9*8 = 72 ways to place the second cell. Continuing this pattern, for the third cell, we have 8 available spots with 7 adjacent free spots, so 8*7 = 56 ways to place it. For the fourth cell, we have 7 available spots with 6 adjacent free spots, so 7*6 = 42 ways to place it. We can continue this pattern until we reach the ninth cell, which can be placed in a single spot with no adjacent free spots. To find the total number of unique rectangles that can be fit in the 10x9 grid, we add up the number of ways to place each cell: 90 (first cell) + 72 (second cell) + 56 (third cell) + 42 (fourth cell) + . . . + 1 (ninth cell) This is an arithmetic series with the first term (a) equal to 90, the last term (l) equal to 1, and a common difference (d) of -18. The sum (S) of an arithmetic series can be calculated using the formula S = (n/2)*(2a + (n-1)d), where n is the number of terms. In this case, n = 9, so: S = (9/2)*(2*90 + (9-1)*-18) = 9*(180 - 138) = 9*42 = 378 So, there are 378 unique rectangles that can be fit in a 10x9 grid. This solution avoids brute-forcing over sizes by instead considering the number of ways to place each cell in the grid.",

Information you'll need: Question: How many unique rectangles can you fit in a 9x9 grid? Rectangles can be any size as long as they fit within the grid. Please provide a creative solution rather than brute forcing over sizes. Teacher solution: We can solve this problem by thinking about how to define the bounds of a rectangle using lines on the grid, instead of enumerating all possible sizes. A 9x9 grid has 9 rows and 9 columns, but to define rectangles we consider the horizontal and vertical lines that separate these rows and columns. There are 10 horizontal lines (including the boundaries at the top and bottom) and 10 vertical lines (including the left and right boundaries). To define a rectangle, we select two distinct horizontal lines (to serve as the top and bottom bounds) and two distinct vertical lines (to serve as the left and right bounds). The intersection of these chosen bounds gives us a unique rectangle. The number of ways to choose 2 lines from 10 is given by the binomial coefficient: \\[ \\binom{10}{2} = \\frac{10 \\cdot 9}{2} = 45. \\] Therefore, the total number of unique rectangles is the product of the number of choices for the horizontal and vertical bounds: \\[ \\text{Total Rectangles} = \\binom{10}{2} \\times \\binom{10}{2} = 45 \\times 45 = 2025. \\] This approach creatively avoids enumerating individual rectangle sizes and instead uses a combinatorial argument based on choosing boundary lines.

Information you'll need: Question: If the time duration of a photo shot is 1000 microseconds (Î¼s), what is the standard deviation of the number of photons captured by a pixel during a single photo? Assume that shot noise photons land on a particular pixel at a rate of 10 photons per microsecond, and the number of photons hitting the pixel follows a Poisson distribution. Teacher solution: The number of shot noise photons hitting a pixel in a standard photo can be modeled as a Poisson random variable: \\[ X \\sim \\text{Poi}(\\lambda = 10,000) \\] where $\\lambda = 10 \\times 1000 = 10,000$, since the rate is 10 photons per microsecond and the duration is 1000 microseconds. The standard deviation of a Poisson distribution is the square root of its mean: \\[ \\text{Std}(X) = \\sqrt{\\lambda} = \\sqrt{10,000} = 100. \\] Therefore, the standard deviation of the shot noise photons captured in a single standard photo is 100. The Student's Work: To solve this problem, we need to make some assumptions about the number of photons that would be expected to hit the pixel in a given time, and the variance of the Poisson distribution. 1. First, let's assume that the number of photons arriving per microsecond is a constant rate, denoted by Î». This rate could depend on factors such as the light intensity and the sensitivity of the sensor. 2. Since the photo shot duration is 1000 microseconds, the total number of photons arriving during the photo shot is given by the product of the rate and the duration: Total photons = Î» * Duration (in seconds) Total photons = Î» * 1000 microseconds * (1 microsecond/second) Total photons = Î» * 10^-3 seconds 3. Now, we can use the properties of the Poisson distribution: - The mean (expected value) of a Poisson distribution is equal to its parameter Î». - The variance of a Poisson distribution is also equal to its parameter Î». 4. In this case, since we know the mean (total photons) and the variance, we can confirm that the number of photons hitting the pixel indeed follows a Poisson distribution. 5. To find the probability of a specific number of photons hitting the pixel, we can use the probability mass function (PMF) of the Poisson distribution: PMF(k) = (e^(-Î») * Î»^k) / k! Where k is the number of photons, and Î» is the mean (total photons). 6. To find the probability of a specific number of photons, simply plug in the values for Î» and k into the PMF formula. For example, to find the probability of exactly 500 photons hitting the pixel: PMF(500) = (e^(-Î») * Î»^500) / 500! 7.

Since we have 150 friends out of a total population of 17,000, the probability of not seeing a friend is: P(Not Friend) = (Total Population - Number of Friends) / Total Population = (17,000 - 150) / 17,000 = 0. 9941 (approximately) Since each encounter is independent, the probability of not seeing any friends among the 100 people we encounter is: P(Not Friend 100 times) = (0. 9941)^100 â‰ˆ 0. 000000998 Now, we can find the probability of seeing at least one friend by subtracting the above value from 1: P(See at least one friend) = 1 - P(Not Friend 100 times) = 1 - 0. 000000998 â‰ˆ 0. 999999002 So, the probability of having a serendipitous encounter with at least one friend when you randomly encounter 100 people is approximately 0. 999999002 or 99. 9999%. This means there's a very high chance of running into at least one friend in this scenario.",

Information you'll need: Question: What is the probability of a serendipitous encounter with a friend? Imagine you live in an area with a large general population (e. g. Stanford with 17,000 students). A small subset of the population are friends. What are the chances that you run into at least one friend if you see a handful of people from the population? Assume that seeing each person from the population is equally likely. In this case, the total population is 17,000, you have 150 friends, and you randomly encounter 100 people. Teacher solution: The probability that you see at least one friend is approximately 0. 5889. \\[ p = \\text{total population} = 17000 \\] \\[ s = \\text{people seen} = 100 \\] \\[ f = \\text{number of friends} = 150 \\]. Since each way of seeing $s$ people is equally likely, we use the equally likely events probability calculation: \\[ P(E) = \\frac{|E|}{|S|} \\] where $S$ is the sample space (all the ways of seeing $s$ people), and $E$ is the event set (all the ways of seeing $s$ people where at least one is a friend). To simplify the problem, we calculate the probability of not seeing any friends and subtract it from 1. Probability that you don't see friends: \\[ P(\\text{not seen}) = \\frac{\\binom{p - f}{s}}{\\binom{p}{s}} \\]. Probability that you see at least one friend: \\[ P(\\text{seen}) = 1 - \\frac{\\binom{p - f}{s}}{\\binom{p}{s}} \\] Numerically, this evaluates to approximately 0. 5889.

In the class, each student has their work evaluated by 5 peers, and every student is asked to evaluate 6 assignments: five peers and one control assignment (graders were unaware of which assignment was the control).

This is analogous to bootstrapping! To determine this \"variance of the mean,\" we just sample 5 grades, take the mean, and repeat, and then take the variance of all of those means. ```python means = [] for i in range(10000): sample = np. random. choice(grades, 5, replace=True) means. append(np. mean(sample)) print(np. var(means)) ``` The variance of the mean is 101. 26. Note that with fewer iterations for the for loop, you might get a number that varies run-to-run. For part b, we repeat this process, but take the median instead of the mean inside the for loop. The variance of the median is 56. 021. You could conclude that the median is better simply because it has a lower variance. A better argument can be made by looking at the histogram of grades given to the control experiment, which shows that there are extreme outliers in the distribution that would skew the mean, but not the median. The Student's Work: To find the average grade for the control assignment, we can use the mean of the grades given by the peers. Here's a step-by-step solution: 1. Open the file `peerGrades. csv` and read the data. The data will likely be in a tabular format with columns for student IDs and their respective grades. 2. Calculate the sum of all grades. 3. Count the total number of grades (the number of students who evaluated the control assignment). 4. Divide the sum of all grades by the total number of grades to get the mean grade. Here's a Python code example using the pandas library: ```python import pandas as pd # Load the data data = pd. read_csv('peerGrades. csv') # Calculate the sum of all grades total_grades = data['Grade']. sum() # Count the total number of grades num_grades = data. shape[0] # Calculate the mean grade mean_grade = total_grades / num_grades print(f\"The mean grade for the control assignment is: {mean_grade}\") ``` Replace 'Grade' with the appropriate column name if it's different in your dataset.

Information you'll need: Question: How many unique rectangles can you fit in a 9x9 grid? Rectangles can be any size as long as they fit within the grid. Please provide a creative solution rather than brute forcing over sizes. Teacher solution: We can solve this problem by thinking about how to define the bounds of a rectangle using lines on the grid, instead of enumerating all possible sizes. A 9x9 grid has 9 rows and 9 columns, but to define rectangles we consider the horizontal and vertical lines that separate these rows and columns. There are 10 horizontal lines (including the boundaries at the top and bottom) and 10 vertical lines (including the left and right boundaries). To define a rectangle, we select two distinct horizontal lines (to serve as the top and bottom bounds) and two distinct vertical lines (to serve as the left and right bounds). The intersection of these chosen bounds gives us a unique rectangle. The number of ways to choose 2 lines from 10 is given by the binomial coefficient: \\[ \\binom{10}{2} = \\frac{10 \\cdot 9}{2} = 45. \\] Therefore, the total number of unique rectangles is the product of the number of choices for the horizontal and vertical bounds: \\[ \\text{Total Rectangles} = \\binom{10}{2} \\times \\binom{10}{2} = 45 \\times 45 = 2025. \\] This approach creatively avoids enumerating individual rectangle sizes and instead uses a combinatorial argument based on choosing boundary lines. The Student's Work: To approach this problem creatively, let's consider the following: 1. We can divide the 9x9 grid into smaller 3x3 sub-grids. Each sub-grid can contain a maximum of one rectangle since they are non-overlapping and fit entirely within the sub-grid. 2. In each 3x3 sub-grid, we have 7 possible rectangle sizes (excluding the size of the sub-grid itself): - 1x1, 2x1, 1x2, 2x2, 1x3, 3x1, and 1x2 (since 3x3 is the size of the sub-grid). 3. However, since we are counting unique rectangles across the entire 9x9 grid, we should account for rotations. For example, a 1x2 rectangle is the same as a 2x1 rectangle. So, we need to divide the count by 2 for the 1x2 and 2x1 rectangles. 4. Now, we have 6 unique rectangle sizes (1x1, 2x1, 1x2, 2x2, 1x3, and 3x1) for each sub-grid. 5. Since there are 9 sub-grids in the 9x9 grid, the total number of unique rectangles is 9 * 6 = 54. However, this solution assumes that we can fit a 1x1 rectangle in every cell, which is not possible due to the grid's structure. To account for this, we should subtract the number of cells in the 9x9 grid, which is 9*9 = 81. So, the final answer is 54 - 81 = -27.

Information you'll need: Question: How many unique rectangles can you fit in a 9x9 grid? Rectangles can be any size as long as they fit within the grid. Please provide a creative solution rather than brute forcing over sizes. Teacher solution: We can solve this problem by thinking about how to define the bounds of a rectangle using lines on the grid, instead of enumerating all possible sizes. A 9x9 grid has 9 rows and 9 columns, but to define rectangles we consider the horizontal and vertical lines that separate these rows and columns. There are 10 horizontal lines (including the boundaries at the top and bottom) and 10 vertical lines (including the left and right boundaries). To define a rectangle, we select two distinct horizontal lines (to serve as the top and bottom bounds) and two distinct vertical lines (to serve as the left and right bounds). The intersection of these chosen bounds gives us a unique rectangle. The number of ways to choose 2 lines from 10 is given by the binomial coefficient: \\[ \\binom{10}{2} = \\frac{10 \\cdot 9}{2} = 45. \\] Therefore, the total number of unique rectangles is the product of the number of choices for the horizontal and vertical bounds: \\[ \\text{Total Rectangles} = \\binom{10}{2} \\times \\binom{10}{2} = 45 \\times 45 = 2025. \\] This approach creatively avoids enumerating individual rectangle sizes and instead uses a combinatorial argument based on choosing boundary lines. The Student's Work: To approach this problem creatively, let's consider the following: 1. We can divide the 9x9 grid into smaller 3x3 sub-grids. Each sub-grid can contain a maximum of one rectangle since they are non-overlapping and fit entirely within the sub-grid. 2. In each 3x3 sub-grid, we have 7 possible rectangle sizes (excluding the size of the sub-grid itself): - 1x1, 2x1, 1x2, 2x2, 1x3, 3x1, and 1x2 (since 3x3 is the size of the sub-grid). 3. However, since we are counting unique rectangles across the entire 9x9 grid, we should account for rotations. For example, a 1x2 rectangle is the same as a 2x1 rectangle. So, we need to divide the count by 2 for the 1x2 and 2x1 rectangles. 4. Now, we have 6 unique rectangle sizes (1x1, 2x1, 1x2, 2x2, 1x3, and 3x1) for each sub-grid. 5. Since there are 9 sub-grids in the 9x9 grid, the total number of unique rectangles is 9 * 6 = 54. However, this solution assumes that we can fit a 1x1 rectangle in every cell, which is not possible due to the grid's structure. To account for this, we should subtract the number of cells in the 9x9 grid, which is 9*9 = 81. So, the final answer is 54 - 81 = -27. However, since we cannot have a negative number of unique rectangles, it means that our initial assumption about fitting a 1x1 rectangle in every cell was incorrect, and the actual number of unique rectangles is less than 54. This problem illustrates that not all rectangles can fit in the 9x9 grid, and a more precise solution would require a case-by-case analysis of each rectangle size and its possible placements within the grid.

Teacher solution: There are \\( \\binom{26}{2} \\) ways to place the first wire, \\( \\binom{24}{2} \\) ways to place the second wire, and \\( \\binom{22}{2} \\) ways to place the third wire. However, because the wires are indistinct, we have overcounted each arrangement by the number of permutations of the three wires (which is $3! $). Therefore, the total number of ways is: \\[ \\text{Total} = \\frac{ \\binom{26}{2} \\cdot \\binom{24}{2} \\cdot \\binom{22}{2} }{3! } = 3,453,450. \\] An alternative way to arrive at the same answer is as follows: First, select the six letters that will be wired (since three wires connect six letters), which can be done in \\( \\binom{26}{6} \\) ways.

Now, to account for self-connections, we need to subtract the number of ways to choose 3 pairs where at least one pair connects a letter to itself. We can do this by adding the number of ways to choose 3 pairs where all pairs connect different letters (C(25, 3)) and subtracting the number of ways to choose 4 pairs where one pair connects the same letter (C(26, 4)). The number of ways to choose 3 pairs where all pairs connect different letters is C(25, 3). The number of ways to choose 4 pairs where one pair connects the same letter is C(26, 4) - C(25, 4). So, the number of valid ways to place 3 wires is: C(26, 3) - [C(25, 3) + C(26, 4) - C(25, 4)] This expression represents the number of valid ways to place 3 wires on the Enigma machine.",

Therefore, the total is also: \\[ \\text{Total} = \\binom{26}{6} \\cdot \\frac{6! }{3! \\cdot 2^3} = 3,453,450. \\] Both methods confirm the same result. The Student's Work: To solve this problem, we can use combinatorics. We want to find the number of ways to choose 3 pairs of letters out of 26, without allowing a pair to connect a letter to itself. First, let's calculate the total number of ways to choose 3 pairs from 26 letters, which is a combination: C(26, 3) = 26! / (3! (26-3)! ) = 26! / (3! * 23! ). Now, to account for self-connections, we need to subtract the number of ways to choose 3 pairs where at least one pair connects a letter to itself. We can do this by adding the number of ways to choose 3 pairs where all pairs connect different letters (C(25, 3)) and subtracting the number of ways to choose 4 pairs where one pair connects the same letter (C(26, 4)). The number of ways to choose 3 pairs where all pairs connect different letters is C(25, 3). The number of ways to choose 4 pairs where one pair connects the same letter is C(26, 4) - C(25, 4). So, the number of valid ways to place 3 wires is: C(26, 3) - [C(25, 3) + C(26, 4) - C(25, 4)] This expression represents the number of valid ways to place 3 wires on the Enigma machine.",

In the class, each student has their work evaluated by 5 peers, and every student is asked to evaluate 6 assignments: five peers and one control assignment (graders were unaware of which assignment was the control).

Hint: it might help to visualize the scores in peerGrades. csv. In order to make your decision compute the statistics in part a) and b). a) Mean of Grades Students could be given a final score which is the mean of the 5 grades given by their peers.

Imagine the control experiment had only received 5 peer-grades. What is the variance of the median grade that the control experiment would have been given? Succinctly describe how you calculated your answer. Enter your estimate of the variance to 1 decimal place as your numeric answer. Teacher solution: First, here's a simple way of loading in the data from the file: ```python with open(filepath, 'r') as f: grades = [int(line) for line in f] ``` We want to simulate the process of taking the mean of 5 grades, over and over, so that we can get an estimate of how much that mean-of-5 varies, depending on the spread of the values in the overall dataset. This is analogous to bootstrapping! To determine this \"variance of the mean,\" we just sample 5 grades, take the mean, and repeat, and then take the variance of all of those means. ```python means = [] for i in range(10000): sample = np. random. choice(grades, 5, replace=True) means. append(np. mean(sample)) print(np. var(means)) ``` The variance of the mean is 101. 26. Note that with fewer iterations for the for loop, you might get a number that varies run-to-run. For part b, we repeat this process, but take the median instead of the mean inside the for loop. The variance of the median is 56. 021. You could conclude that the median is better simply because it has a lower variance. A better argument can be made by looking at the histogram of grades given to the control experiment, which shows that there are extreme outliers in the distribution that would skew the mean, but not the median. The Student's Work: a) Mean of Grades: To calculate the variance of the mean of five grades, we first need to understand the variance of a single grade. Since we don't have the actual grades, let's assume that the grades are normally distributed with a mean of Î¼ and standard deviation Ïƒ. The variance of a single grade would be Ïƒ^2. When we take the mean of five grades, the variance of the mean ( Var(mean) ) is given by the formula: Var(mean) = Ïƒ^2 / n, where n is the number of grades. In this case, n is 5. So, the variance of the mean of five grades is Ïƒ^2 / 5. b) Median of Grades: The median of a set of grades doesn't change when we add or remove outliers, so the median grade remains the same whether we have 5 or 6 grades. The variance of the median is a bit more complex to calculate, as it's not straightforward to find the variance of a median itself. However, we can use the concept of the \"Median Absolute Deviation\" (MAD) as an approximation of the variance of the median. The MAD is the median of the absolute deviations from the median. To find the variance, we square the MAD and multiply by a factor of 1. 4826 (the Gordon-Hall factor), which is an approximation to make the MAD a more accurate approximation of the variance. Since we don't have the actual grades, we can't calculate the MAD directly. But if we assume the grades are normally distributed, we can use the fact that the MAD is approximately 0. 6745 * Ïƒ (the \"interquartile range\" divided by 1. 349). However, the median of the median grade would still be the same as the median of the 6 grades, so the MAD would be the same whether we have 5 or 6 grades. So, the variance of the median grade, as approximated by the MAD, would be (0. 6745 * Ïƒ)^2 * 1. 4826. Since we don't have the actual standard deviation Ïƒ, I can't provide a numerical answer.

Information you'll need: Question: What is the probability of a serendipitous encounter with a friend? Imagine you live in an area with a large general population (e. g. Stanford with 17,000 students). A small subset of the population are friends. What are the chances that you run into at least one friend if you see a handful of people from the population? Assume that seeing each person from the population is equally likely. In this case, the total population is 17,000, you have 150 friends, and you randomly encounter 100 people. Teacher solution: The probability that you see at least one friend is approximately 0. 5889. \\[ p = \\text{total population} = 17000 \\] \\[ s = \\text{people seen} = 100 \\] \\[ f = \\text{number of friends} = 150 \\]. Since each way of seeing $s$ people is equally likely, we use the equally likely events probability calculation: \\[ P(E) = \\frac{|E|}{|S|} \\] where $S$ is the sample space (all the ways of seeing $s$ people), and $E$ is the event set (all the ways of seeing $s$ people where at least one is a friend). To simplify the problem, we calculate the probability of not seeing any friends and subtract it from 1. Probability that you don't see friends: \\[ P(\\text{not seen}) = \\frac{\\binom{p - f}{s}}{\\binom{p}{s}} \\]. Probability that you see at least one friend: \\[ P(\\text{seen}) = 1 - \\frac{\\binom{p - f}{s}}{\\binom{p}{s}} \\] Numerically, this evaluates to approximately 0. 5889. The Student's Work: To solve this problem, we'll use the complementary probability method. Instead of finding the probability of the desired event (seeing at least one friend), we'll find the probability of the complementary event (not seeing any friends) and then subtract it from 1. First, let's calculate the probability of not seeing any friends. This means we'll consider the probability of not seeing each friend individually and then multiply these probabilities together. The probability of not seeing a specific friend (Friend 1) is 1 - (number of people you meet / total population) since you can't meet more people than the total population. P(not seeing Friend 1) = 1 - (number of people you meet / 17,000) Assuming you meet a \"handful\" of people. Let x be the number of people you meet. So, the probability of not seeing Friend 1 is: P(not seeing Friend 1) = 1 - (x / 17000) Now, you have 154 other friends, and for each friend, the probability of not seeing them is the same as the above expression. So, the probability of not seeing all 155 friends is: P(not seeing all friends) = [1 - (x / 17000)]^155 Now, we'll find the probability of seeing at least one friend, which is the complement of the probability of not seeing any friends: P(seeing at least one friend) = 1 - P(not seeing all friends) So, P(seeing at least one friend) = 1 - [1 - (x / 17000)]^155 However, since we don't know the exact number of people you meet (x), we can't find the exact probability. Instead, we can calculate the probability for different values of x (number of people you meet) and interpret the results. For example, if you meet 100 people, the probability of seeing at least one friend is: P(seeing at least one friend) = 1 - [1 - (100 / 17000)]^155 â‰ˆ 0. 8648 This means that, if you meet 100 people, there's approximately an 86. 48% chance that you'll run into at least one friend.",

Information you'll need: Question: What is the probability of a serendipitous encounter with a friend? Imagine you live in an area with a large general population (e. g. Stanford with 17,000 students). A small subset of the population are friends. What are the chances that you run into at least one friend if you see a handful of people from the population? Assume that seeing each person from the population is equally likely. In this case, the total population is 17,000, you have 150 friends, and you randomly encounter 100 people. Teacher solution: The probability that you see at least one friend is approximately 0. 5889. \\[ p = \\text{total population} = 17000 \\] \\[ s = \\text{people seen} = 100 \\] \\[ f = \\text{number of friends} = 150 \\]. Since each way of seeing $s$ people is equally likely, we use the equally likely events probability calculation: \\[ P(E) = \\frac{|E|}{|S|} \\] where $S$ is the sample space (all the ways of seeing $s$ people), and $E$ is the event set (all the ways of seeing $s$ people where at least one is a friend). To simplify the problem, we calculate the probability of not seeing any friends and subtract it from 1. Probability that you don't see friends: \\[ P(\\text{not seen}) = \\frac{\\binom{p - f}{s}}{\\binom{p}{s}} \\]. Probability that you see at least one friend: \\[ P(\\text{seen}) = 1 - \\frac{\\binom{p - f}{s}}{\\binom{p}{s}} \\] Numerically, this evaluates to approximately 0. 5889. The Student's Work: To solve this problem, we'll use the complementary probability method. Instead of finding the probability of the desired event (seeing at least one friend), we'll find the probability of the complementary event (not seeing any friends) and then subtract it from 1. First, let's calculate the probability of not seeing any friends. This means we'll consider the probability of not seeing each friend individually and then multiply these probabilities together. The probability of not seeing a specific friend (Friend 1) is 1 - (number of people you meet / total population) since you can't meet more people than the total population. P(not seeing Friend 1) = 1 - (number of people you meet / 17,000) Assuming you meet a \"handful\" of people. Let x be the number of people you meet. So, the probability of not seeing Friend 1 is: P(not seeing Friend 1) = 1 - (x / 17000) Now, you have 154 other friends, and for each friend, the probability of not seeing them is the same as the above expression. So, the probability of not seeing all 155 friends is: P(not seeing all friends) = [1 - (x / 17000)]^155 Now, we'll find the probability of seeing at least one friend, which is the complement of the probability of not seeing any friends: P(seeing at least one friend) = 1 - P(not seeing all friends) So, P(seeing at least one friend) = 1 - [1 - (x / 17000)]^155 However, since we don't know the exact number of people you meet (x), we can't find the exact probability. Instead, we can calculate the probability for different values of x (number of people you meet) and interpret the results. For example, if you meet 100 people, the probability of seeing at least one friend is: P(seeing at least one friend) = 1 - [1 - (100 / 17000)]^155 â‰ˆ 0. 8648 This means that, if you meet 100 people, there's approximately an 86. 48% chance that you'll run into at least one friend.",
        "chosen": "Correct approach but incorrect formula. Use combination formula instead of direct multiplication for not seeing friends. Correct formula: \\( P(\\text{not seeing all friends}) = \\frac{\\binom{17000-150}{100}}{\\binom{17000}{100}} \\). This gives the right probability of around 0. 5889.",

You should explain that it's often easier to calculate the probability of the complement of an event (not seeing any friends) and then subtract it from 1. 2. **Incorrect assumption about the probability of not seeing a specific friend**: You stated that the probability of not seeing a specific friend is 1 - (number of people you meet / total population). However, this is incorrect. The probability of not seeing a specific friend is actually (total population - number of friends) / total population, not 1 - (number of people you meet / total population). 3. **Incorrect expression for P(not seeing all friends)**: You used the expression [1 - (x / 17000)]^155, which is incorrect. The correct expression should be [ (total population - number of friends) / total population ]^s, where s is the number of people seen. 4. **Lack of explanation for the final expression**: You derived the final expression P(seeing at least one friend) = 1 - [1 - (x / 17000)]^155, but didn't explain why it's correct. You should explain that this expression is the complement of the probability of not seeing any friends, and that it's a result of applying the complementary probability method. **Corrective guidance:** - Explain the complementary probability method and its suitability for this problem. - Correct the probability of not seeing a specific friend: it's (total population - number of friends) / total population. - Use the correct expression for P(not seeing all friends): [ (total population - number of friends) / total population ]^s. - Explain the final expression and its derivation.",

Program B will run 20 algorithms in sequence, with the running time for each algorithm being independent random variables with mean = 52 seconds and variance = 200 seconds$^2$. What is the approximate probability that Program A completes in less time than B? Give an answer to three decimal places. Teacher solution: Let $X_A$ be the running time of program A, and $X_B$ be the running time of program B. Using the Central Limit Theorem, we can find the distributions of $X_A$ and $X_B$: \\[ X_A \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu = 20 \\cdot 50,\\ \\sigma^2 = 20 \\cdot 100) \\] \\[ X_B \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu = 20 \\cdot 52,\\ \\sigma^2 = 20 \\cdot 200) \\] Define a new random variable $X_{A-B}$, representing the difference in running times between program A and program B. Since the sum or difference between two normal random variables is also normal: \\[ X_{A-B} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu = 1000 - 1040,\\ \\sigma^2 = 2000 + 4000) \\] \\[ X_{A-B} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(-40,\\ 6000) \\] Note that we subtract the means, but add the variances. This is because subtracting the two normals is the same as transforming $X_B$ into $(-1) \\cdot X_B$, then adding that to $X_A$. If program A finishes in less time than program B, then $X_{A-B} < 0$. We can calculate the probability of this as: \\[ P(X_{A-B} < 0) = \\Phi\\left( \\frac{0 - (-40)}{\\sqrt{6000}} \\right) = \\Phi(0. 516) \\approx 0. 697 \\] The Student's Work: To solve this problem, we will use the concept of the cumulative distribution function (CDF) and compare the expected running times of both programs. First, let's find the standard deviation (Ïƒ) for each program. For Program A, Ïƒ = sqrt(100 seconds^2) = 10 seconds. For Program B, Ïƒ = sqrt(200 seconds^2) = 14. 14 seconds. Since the running times are independent and normally distributed, we can compare the expected completion times of both programs using the z-score, which allows us to compare means of different distributions. The z-score is calculated as (X - Î¼) / Ïƒ, where X is the observed value, Î¼ is the mean, and Ïƒ is the standard deviation. For Program A, the expected completion time for one algorithm is 50 seconds, so the z-score for Program A is (0 - 50) / 10 = -5. 0. For Program B, the expected completion time for one algorithm is 100 seconds, so the z-score for Program B is (0 - 100) / 14. 14 = -7. 03. Since the z-scores represent the number of standard deviations away from the mean, Program A has a z-score that is 5. 0 standard deviations below its mean, while Program B has a z-score that is 7. 03 standard deviations below its mean. Now, we can use the standard normal distribution table or a calculator to find the probability for each z-score. The probability of a z-score less than -5. 0 for Program A is approximately 0. 000067, and the probability of a z-score less than -7. 03 for Program B is approximately 0. 00000024. Since Program A completes one algorithm faster than Program B, the probability that Program A completes all 20 algorithms in less time than Program B is the product of the probabilities for each algorithm. However, it's important to note that the independence assumption for the algorithms within each program may not hold, and the actual probability could be different from the calculated value.

What is the probability that a randomly chosen bacterium survives the antibiotics? Teacher solution: Let $E$ be the event that a bacterium survives.

The Student's Work: In this problem, we are given a population of 1 million infectious bacteria in the gut. To understand the probability of any event related to these bacteria, we need to define the events of interest. Let's consider two possible events: 1. Picking a single bacterium randomly from the population: Since there are 1,000,000 bacteria in total, the probability of picking any single bacterium is 1 (certainty), as the event of drawing one bacterium from the population is guaranteed to occur if we are allowed to draw one bacterium. However, the probability of picking an infectious bacterium is equal to the fraction of infectious bacteria in the population. Since all bacteria are infectious, this fraction is 1, and so the probability of picking an infectious bacterium is also 1. 2. Picking a specific bacterium from the population: In this case, the probability of picking a specific bacterium depends on the number of times we draw bacteria from the population. For example, if we draw bacteria one by one without replacement, the probability of picking a specific bacterium is the fraction of that bacterium in the population. Since we know there are 1,000,000 bacteria, the probability of picking a specific bacterium is 1/1,000,000. In summary, the probability of picking an infectious bacterium is 1 (certainty) as all bacteria are infectious.

By the Law of Total Probability (LOTP): \\[ P(E) = P(E \\text{ and } M) + P(E \\text{ and } M^C) \\] Applying the Chain Rule: \\[ P(E) = P(E|M)P(M) + P(E|M^C)P(M^C) \\] Substituting the given values: \\[ P(E) = 0. 20 \\cdot 0. 10 + 0. 01 \\cdot 0. 90 \\] \\[ P(E) = 0. 029 \\] Therefore, the probability that a randomly chosen bacterium survives the antibiotics is 0. 029. The Student's Work: In this problem, we are given a population of 1 million infectious bacteria in the gut. To understand the probability of any event related to these bacteria, we need to define the events of interest. Let's consider two possible events: 1. Picking a single bacterium randomly from the population: Since there are 1,000,000 bacteria in total, the probability of picking any single bacterium is 1 (certainty), as the event of drawing one bacterium from the population is guaranteed to occur if we are allowed to draw one bacterium. However, the probability of picking an infectious bacterium is equal to the fraction of infectious bacteria in the population. Since all bacteria are infectious, this fraction is 1, and so the probability of picking an infectious bacterium is also 1. 2. Picking a specific bacterium from the population: In this case, the probability of picking a specific bacterium depends on the number of times we draw bacteria from the population. For example, if we draw bacteria one by one without replacement, the probability of picking a specific bacterium is the fraction of that bacterium in the population. Since we know there are 1,000,000 bacteria, the probability of picking a specific bacterium is 1/1,000,000. In summary, the probability of picking an infectious bacterium is 1 (certainty) as all bacteria are infectious. However, the probability of picking a specific bacterium from the population depends on the number of times we draw bacteria and the number of that bacterium in the population.",

Information you'll need: Question: When recommending movies, Netflix cares about estimating the probability that a user will like a given movie, based on their viewing history. To make this problem tractable, they classify movies into specific genres such as 'Tearjerker' or 'Quirky Romance'. The probability that a Netflix user likes a movie $T_i$ from the 'Tearjerker' genre is given by: Given that they like the Tearjerker genre, $p_i = 0. 4$. Given that they do not like the Tearjerker genre, $q_i = 0. 9$. 60% of Netflix users like the Tearjerker genre. Netflix assumes that, given a userâ€™s preference for the genre, liking movie $T_i$ and $T_j$ are conditionally independent events for any movies $i$ and $j$. What is the probability that they like movies $T_1$, $T_2$, or $T_3$ given that they like the Tearjerker genre? Teacher solution: Let $L_i | G$ be the event that they like movie $T_i$ given that they like the Tearjerker genre. The probability that they like at least one of the movies $T_1$, $T_2$, or $T_3$ given that they like the genre is: \\[ \\text{Answer} = P(L_1 | G \\text{ or } L_2 | G \\text{ or } L_3 | G) \\] Using the complement rule: \\[ = 1 - P(L_1^C | G \\text{ and } L_2^C | G \\text{ and } L_3^C | G) \\] Since the events are conditionally independent: \\[ = 1 - (1 - p_1)(1 - p_2)(1 - p_3) \\] An alternative approach uses the inclusion/exclusion principle: \\[ P(L_1 | G \\text{ or } L_2 | G \\text{ or } L_3 | G) = p_1 + p_2 + p_3 - (p_1 p_2) - (p_1 p_3) - (p_2 p_3) + (p_1 p_2 p_3). \\] The Student's Work: To solve this problem, we will use Bayes' theorem to calculate the conditional probability of a user liking a specific 'Tearjerker' movie, given that they like or dislike the Tearjerker genre. First, let's define some variables: - $P(T_i)$: The probability of a user liking movie $T_i$ - $P(T_i | Tearjerker)$: The probability of a user liking movie $T_i$ given that they like the Tearjerker genre - $P(T_i | Not\\ Tearjerker)$: The probability of a user liking movie $T_i$ given that they do not like the Tearjerker genre - $P(Tearjerker)$: The probability of a user liking the Tearjerker genre We are given: 1. $P(T_i | Tearjerker) = 0. 4$ 2. $P(T_i | Not\\ Tearjerker) = 0. 9$ 3. $P(Tearjerker) = 0. 6$ Since all events are assumed to be independent, the conditional probability of a user liking movie $T_i$ and movie $T_j$ given that they like the Tearjerker genre is the product of their individual probabilities: $P(T_i, T_j | Tearjerker) = P(T_i | Tearjerker) \\times P(T_j | Tearjerker)$ Now, we want to find the probability of a user liking movie $T_i$ given that they like the Tearjerker genre. To do this, we can use Bayes' theorem: $P(T_i | Tearjerker) = \\frac{P(Tearjerker | T_i) \\times P(T_i)}{P(Tearjerker)}$ Plugging in the given values: $P(T_i | Tearjerker) = \\frac{P(Tearjerker | T_i) \\times P(T_i)}{P(Tearjerker)}$ $P(T_i | Tearjerker) = \\frac{(0. 4) \\times P(T_i)}{0. 6}$ Since the probability of a user liking a movie is either 0 or 1, we have: $P(T_i) = 0. 4 \\times \\frac{0. 6}{P(T_i | Tearjerker)}$ $P(T_i | Tearjerker) \\times P(T_i) = 0. 24$ Now, we can solve for $P(T_i | Tearjerker)$: $P(T_i | Tearjerker) = \\sqrt{\\frac{0. 24}{P(T_i)}}$ Since we don't know the specific value of $P(T_i)$, we cannot find a concrete value for $P(T_i | Tearjerker)$. However, we have the relationship between the two probabilities. This means that the probability of a user liking a movie given that they like the Tearjerker genre is proportional to the square root of the probability of a user liking the movie. Finally, given that all events are independent, the liking of movies $T_i$, $T_2$, and $T_3$ are also conditionally independent events given that they like the Tearjerker genre.

Assume that shot noise photons land on a particular pixel at a rate of 10 photons per microsecond, and the number of photons hitting the pixel follows a Poisson distribution.

Teacher solution: We can solve this problem by thinking about how to define the bounds of a rectangle using lines on the grid, instead of enumerating all possible sizes. A 9x9 grid has 9 rows and 9 columns, but to define rectangles we consider the horizontal and vertical lines that separate these rows and columns. There are 10 horizontal lines (including the boundaries at the top and bottom) and 10 vertical lines (including the left and right boundaries). To define a rectangle, we select two distinct horizontal lines (to serve as the top and bottom bounds) and two distinct vertical lines (to serve as the left and right bounds). The intersection of these chosen bounds gives us a unique rectangle. The number of ways to choose 2 lines from 10 is given by the binomial coefficient: \\[ \\binom{10}{2} = \\frac{10 \\cdot 9}{2} = 45. \\] Therefore, the total number of unique rectangles is the product of the number of choices for the horizontal and vertical bounds: \\[ \\text{Total Rectangles} = \\binom{10}{2} \\times \\binom{10}{2} = 45 \\times 45 = 2025. \\] This approach creatively avoids enumerating individual rectangle sizes and instead uses a combinatorial argument based on choosing boundary lines. The Student's Work: To solve this problem creatively, let's consider the dimensions of the rectangles. Since we're dealing with a 9x9 grid, the largest rectangle that can fit entirely within it would have dimensions 9x9. However, we want to find the total number of unique rectangles, which means we should also consider smaller rectangles. The key insight is that we can treat the grid as a 9x9 checkerboard, with 81 squares, each of side length 1. Now, let's think about how many ways we can join these squares to form rectangles. 1. For a rectangle to be formed, we need to select two sides of the same length. This is because the length and width of a rectangle are interchangeable. 2. The length of the sides of the rectangle can range from 1 to 9, and there are 9 possible lengths. 3. For each length, the number of sides we select is equal to the number of rows or columns we want to use for that length. Since the grid is a square, the number of rows and columns is the same (9). 4. So, for each length, the number of ways to select the sides is the number of ways to choose rows (or columns), which is given by the binomial coefficient: C(n, k) = n! / [k! (n-k)! ], where n is the total number of items (sides), and k is the number of items we want to choose (rows or columns). 5. To find the total number of unique rectangles, we sum up the number of ways to form rectangles for each length: Total rectangles = Î£ (C(9, k) * k^2), where k ranges from 1 to 9. This solution provides a creative way to find the total number of unique rectangles that can fit in a 9x9 grid without brute forcing over sizes. The expression above can be evaluated to find the final answer.",

You take a course of antibiotics. The probability that bacteria with the mutation survive is 20%. The probability that bacteria without the mutation survive is 1%. What is the probability that a randomly chosen bacterium survives the antibiotics? Teacher solution: Let $E$ be the event that a bacterium survives.

A wire cannot connect a letter to itself, and the wires are indistinct (e. g. , a wire connecting 'K' to 'L' is the same as one connecting 'L' to 'K'). How many ways are there to place exactly three wires connecting pairs of letters, given that there are 26 letters in total? Teacher solution: There are \\( \\binom{26}{2} \\) ways to place the first wire, \\( \\binom{24}{2} \\) ways to place the second wire, and \\( \\binom{22}{2} \\) ways to place the third wire. However, because the wires are indistinct, we have overcounted each arrangement by the number of permutations of the three wires (which is $3! $). Therefore, the total number of ways is: \\[ \\text{Total} = \\frac{ \\binom{26}{2} \\cdot \\binom{24}{2} \\cdot \\binom{22}{2} }{3! } = 3,453,450. \\] An alternative way to arrive at the same answer is as follows: First, select the six letters that will be wired (since three wires connect six letters), which can be done in \\( \\binom{26}{6} \\) ways. Then, permute these six letters in $6! $ ways and group them into pairs. But this overcounts in two ways: (1) by a factor of $3! $ for the ordering of the three pairs, and (2) by a factor of $2^3$ because the ordering within each pair does not matter. Therefore, the total is also: \\[ \\text{Total} = \\binom{26}{6} \\cdot \\frac{6! }{3! \\cdot 2^3} = 3,453,450. \\] Both methods confirm the same result. The Student's Work: To solve this problem, we can use the concept of combinations. In this case, we have 6 pairs of letters to be connected by the wires, and each pair has 26 choices for both ends (since the wires are indistinct). However, since we are connecting the same pair twice (one way for each direction), we should divide by 2 to avoid counting these twice. The number of ways to choose 2 letters out of 26 for each of the 6 pairs is given by the combination formula: C(n, k) = n! / (k! (n-k)! ) Here, n = 26 (total letters) and k = 2 (letters in a pair) So, the number of ways to choose pairs is: C(26, 2) = 26! / (2! * (26-2)! ) = 26! / (2! * 24! ) = (26 * 25) / (2 * 1) = 325 Since we are dividing by 2 to avoid double-counting, the total number of ways to connect exactly three wires is 325 / 2 = 162. 5.

Information you'll need: Question: You are trying to find a time when two people can meet. Assume a day is composed of 8 one hour blocks. Each block has $p = 0. 7$ probability of being busy for each person. We assume that whether each block is busy for a person is independent of whether other blocks are busy for them, and also independent of whether that block is busy for other people. Question: Two people are trying to schedule a meeting. What is the probability that there is at least one block of time when they are both free on a given day? Provide an answer to 3 decimal places. Teacher solution: Solving this problem requires us to recognize how helpful it is to take the complement a few times. First, since we are looking for the probability that at least one block of time is free for both people, we can simplify our calculations by taking the complement of at least one and instead finding one minus the probability that all blocks of time are busy for at least one of the two people. P(1+ time free for both) = 1 - P(all times busy)= 1 - P(block 1 busy âˆ© block 2 busy âˆ© . . . âˆ© block 8 busy)= 1 - P(a block is busy for at least one person)^8 We break down the probability of and above by noting that independence between blocks lets us multiply together the probabilities for the individual blocks being busy. Now we have another at least event. At least one person being busy means exactly one person is busy, or both of them are busy. You could use inclusion-exclusion here (probability of or without mutual exclusion, where you need to subtract the intersection), but we could also just take the complement again:= 1 - P(a block is busy for at least one person)^8= 1 - (1 - P(block is free for both people))^8= 1 - (1 - P(person 1 free âˆ© person 2 free))^8= 1 - (1 - P(person is free for one block)^2)^8= 1 - (1 - (1 - 0. 7)^2)^8. Above, we used independence between people to break down a probability of and into the product of the probability that one person is free for a particular block, and finally, we plugged in the complement of the probability that a person is busy for one block. The Student's Work: To solve this problem, we'll use the complementary probability method. Instead of finding the probability that both people are free in at least one block, we'll find the probability that they are both busy in all blocks, and then subtract that from 1. First, let's find the probability that both people are busy in a single block. Since the events are independent, we can multiply the probabilities: P(busy for both) = P(person 1 is busy) * P(person 2 is busy) = 0. 7 * 0. 7 = 0. 49 Since there are 8 one-hour blocks in a day, the probability that both people are busy in all 8 blocks is: P(both busy in all blocks) = (0. 49)^8 â‰ˆ 0. 0033 Now, we can find the probability that there is at least one block when they are both free: P(at least one free block) = 1 - P(both busy in all blocks) = 1 - 0. 0033 â‰ˆ 0. 9967 So, the probability that there is at least one block of time when they can meet, to 3 decimal places, is approximately 0. 997.",

Information you'll need: Question: You are trying to find a time when two people can meet. Assume a day is composed of 8 one hour blocks. Each block has $p = 0. 7$ probability of being busy for each person. We assume that whether each block is busy for a person is independent of whether other blocks are busy for them, and also independent of whether that block is busy for other people. Question: Two people are trying to schedule a meeting. What is the probability that there is at least one block of time when they are both free on a given day? Provide an answer to 3 decimal places. Teacher solution: Solving this problem requires us to recognize how helpful it is to take the complement a few times. First, since we are looking for the probability that at least one block of time is free for both people, we can simplify our calculations by taking the complement of at least one and instead finding one minus the probability that all blocks of time are busy for at least one of the two people. P(1+ time free for both) = 1 - P(all times busy)= 1 - P(block 1 busy âˆ© block 2 busy âˆ© . . . âˆ© block 8 busy)= 1 - P(a block is busy for at least one person)^8 We break down the probability of and above by noting that independence between blocks lets us multiply together the probabilities for the individual blocks being busy. Now we have another at least event. At least one person being busy means exactly one person is busy, or both of them are busy. You could use inclusion-exclusion here (probability of or without mutual exclusion, where you need to subtract the intersection), but we could also just take the complement again:= 1 - P(a block is busy for at least one person)^8= 1 - (1 - P(block is free for both people))^8= 1 - (1 - P(person 1 free âˆ© person 2 free))^8= 1 - (1 - P(person is free for one block)^2)^8= 1 - (1 - (1 - 0. 7)^2)^8. Above, we used independence between people to break down a probability of and into the product of the probability that one person is free for a particular block, and finally, we plugged in the complement of the probability that a person is busy for one block. The Student's Work: To solve this problem, we'll use the complementary probability method. Instead of finding the probability that both people are free in at least one block, we'll find the probability that they are both busy in all blocks, and then subtract that from 1. First, let's find the probability that both people are busy in a single block. Since the events are independent, we can multiply the probabilities: P(busy for both) = P(person 1 is busy) * P(person 2 is busy) = 0. 7 * 0. 7 = 0. 49 Since there are 8 one-hour blocks in a day, the probability that both people are busy in all 8 blocks is: P(both busy in all blocks) = (0. 49)^8 â‰ˆ 0. 0033 Now, we can find the probability that there is at least one block when they are both free: P(at least one free block) = 1 - P(both busy in all blocks) = 1 - 0. 0033 â‰ˆ 0. 9967 So, the probability that there is at least one block of time when they can meet, to 3 decimal places, is approximately 0. 997.",

Information you'll need: Question: Stanford's HCI class runs a massive online class that was taken by ten thousand students. The class used peer assessment to evaluate student work. In the class, each student has their work evaluated by 5 peers, and every student is asked to evaluate 6 assignments: five peers and one control assignment (graders were unaware of which assignment was the control). All 10,000 students evaluated the same control assignment, and the scores they gave are in the file peerGrades. csv. Would you use the mean or the median of 5 peer grades to assign scores in the online version of Stanford's HCI class? Explain why. You may use simulations to solve any part of this question. Hint: it might help to visualize the scores in peerGrades. csv. In order to make your decision compute the statistics in part a) and b). a) Mean of Grades Students could be given a final score which is the mean of the 5 grades given by their peers. Imagine the control experiment had only received 5 peer-grades. What is the variance of the mean of those five grades? Succinctly describe how you calculated your answer. b) Median of Grades Students could be given a final score which is the median of the 5 grades given by their peers. Imagine the control experiment had only received 5 peer-grades. What is the variance of the median grade that the control experiment would have been given? Succinctly describe how you calculated your answer. Enter your estimate of the variance to 1 decimal place as your numeric answer. Teacher solution: First, here's a simple way of loading in the data from the file: ```python with open(filepath, 'r') as f: grades = [int(line) for line in f] ``` We want to simulate the process of taking the mean of 5 grades, over and over, so that we can get an estimate of how much that mean-of-5 varies, depending on the spread of the values in the overall dataset. This is analogous to bootstrapping! To determine this \"variance of the mean,\" we just sample 5 grades, take the mean, and repeat, and then take the variance of all of those means. ```python means = [] for i in range(10000): sample = np. random. choice(grades, 5, replace=True) means. append(np. mean(sample)) print(np. var(means)) ``` The variance of the mean is 101. 26. Note that with fewer iterations for the for loop, you might get a number that varies run-to-run. For part b, we repeat this process, but take the median instead of the mean inside the for loop. The variance of the median is 56. 021. You could conclude that the median is better simply because it has a lower variance. A better argument can be made by looking at the histogram of grades given to the control experiment, which shows that there are extreme outliers in the distribution that would skew the mean, but not the median. The Student's Work: a) Mean of Grades: To calculate the variance of the mean, we first need to understand that the variance of a sample mean is given by the formula: Variance of Mean = Variance of the population / Sample size In this case, the population is the 5 peer grades given to the control experiment. Let's assume the grades are represented by the values x1, x2, x3, x4, x5. The variance of the population is given by: Variance of Population = (Sum of (xi - Mean)Â²) / (Number of grades - 1) The mean of the population is (x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 + x5) / 5. So, the variance of the mean would be: Variance of Mean = (Variance of Population) / 5 However, we are not given the actual grades, so we can't calculate the exact variance. But we can say that the variance of the mean will be less than the variance of a single grade because the mean tends to smooth out the individual variations in grades. b) Median of Grades: The median of a set of numbers is the middle value when the numbers are arranged in ascending or descending order. In this case, the median is the average of the 3rd and 4th grades when the grades are arranged in ascending order. The variance of the median cannot be calculated directly because the median is a rank-based measure and not a measure of the dispersion of individual values. The variance of the median is not a useful statistic because the median is not affected by the spread of the data, only by the distribution's shape and location. Since we are calculating the variance of the median of a sample of size 2 (the average of the 3rd and 4th grades), the variance would be 0, because the variance is a measure of how spread out the data is, and the median of two values is always the same distance away from each other, regardless of the actual values. In summary, if you are asked to decide whether to use the mean or median for grading, the mean would be a better choice because it takes into account the spread of the grades, while the median does not. However, if the data is heavily skewed, the median might be more robust to outliers. But in this case, we don't have enough information to make a definitive choice.

Stanford with 17,000 students). A small subset of the population are friends. What are the chances that you run into at least one friend if you see a handful of people from the population? Assume that seeing each person from the population is equally likely. In this case, the total population is 17,000, you have 150 friends, and you randomly encounter 100 people. Teacher solution: The probability that you see at least one friend is approximately 0. 5889. \\[ p = \\text{total population} = 17000 \\] \\[ s = \\text{people seen} = 100 \\] \\[ f = \\text{number of friends} = 150 \\].

The Student's Work: To solve this problem, we will use the complementary probability method. Instead of finding the probability of seeing at least one friend, we'll find the probability of not seeing any friends and then subtract that from 1. 1. First, let's find the probability of not seeing a friend when encountering one person. Since there are 148 friends out of a total population of 17,000, the probability of not seeing a friend is: P(not seeing a friend) = 1 - P(seeing a friend) = 1 - (Number of friends / Total population) = 1 - (148 / 17000) = 0. 99177778 (rounded to 7 decimal places) 2.

To find the probability of not seeing any friends in 100 encounters, we'll use the formula for the binomial probability: P(not seeing any friends in 100 encounters) = (P(not seeing a friend))^100 = (0. 99177778)^100 = 0. 000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",

Information you'll need: Question: What is the probability of a serendipitous encounter with a friend? Imagine you live in an area with a large general population (e. g. Stanford with 17,000 students). A small subset of the population are friends. What are the chances that you run into at least one friend if you see a handful of people from the population? Assume that seeing each person from the population is equally likely. In this case, the total population is 17,000, you have 150 friends, and you randomly encounter 100 people. Teacher solution: The probability that you see at least one friend is approximately 0. 5889. \\[ p = \\text{total population} = 17000 \\] \\[ s = \\text{people seen} = 100 \\] \\[ f = \\text{number of friends} = 150 \\]. Since each way of seeing $s$ people is equally likely, we use the equally likely events probability calculation: \\[ P(E) = \\frac{|E|}{|S|} \\] where $S$ is the sample space (all the ways of seeing $s$ people), and $E$ is the event set (all the ways of seeing $s$ people where at least one is a friend). To simplify the problem, we calculate the probability of not seeing any friends and subtract it from 1. Probability that you don't see friends: \\[ P(\\text{not seen}) = \\frac{\\binom{p - f}{s}}{\\binom{p}{s}} \\]. Probability that you see at least one friend: \\[ P(\\text{seen}) = 1 - \\frac{\\binom{p - f}{s}}{\\binom{p}{s}} \\] Numerically, this evaluates to approximately 0. 5889. The Student's Work: To solve this problem, we will use the complementary probability method. Instead of finding the probability of seeing at least one friend, we'll find the probability of not seeing any friends and then subtract that from 1. 1. First, let's find the probability of not seeing a friend when encountering one person. Since there are 148 friends out of a total population of 17,000, the probability of not seeing a friend is: P(not seeing a friend) = 1 - P(seeing a friend) = 1 - (Number of friends / Total population) = 1 - (148 / 17000) = 0. 99177778 (rounded to 7 decimal places) 2.

If you choose two shapes with replacement, what is the probability that the two shapes are the same? Note that it is possible to get two triangles: after you pick the first triangle, you put it back into the set of shapes and it can be chosen again.

There are two ways this can happen: (1) both shapes are squares, or (2) both shapes are triangles. Define $A$ as the event of selecting two squares, and $B$ as the event of selecting two triangles. These two events are mutually exclusive. The number of ways to choose two squares is \\[ |A| = 6 \\times 6 = 36 \\] since there are 6 squares and we choose one twice (with replacement).

So the probability of drawing a square or a triangle on the first draw is 7/7 = 1 (since one shape will definitely be drawn). Now, since we are drawing with replacement, the probability of drawing the same shape again on the second draw is the same as the probability of drawing that shape in the first place, regardless of what we drew in the first draw. So the probability of drawing the same shape twice is (probability of drawing a square or triangle) * (probability of drawing the same shape again), which is: (7/7) * (7/7) = (7^2) / (7^2) = 49/49 = 1.

Each block has $p = 0. 7$ probability of being busy for each person. We assume that whether each block is busy for a person is independent of whether other blocks are busy for them, and also independent of whether that block is busy for other people. Question: Two people are trying to schedule a meeting. What is the probability that there is at least one block of time when they are both free on a given day? Provide an answer to 3 decimal places. Teacher solution: Solving this problem requires us to recognize how helpful it is to take the complement a few times. First, since we are looking for the probability that at least one block of time is free for both people, we can simplify our calculations by taking the complement of at least one and instead finding one minus the probability that all blocks of time are busy for at least one of the two people. P(1+ time free for both) = 1 - P(all times busy)= 1 - P(block 1 busy âˆ© block 2 busy âˆ© . . . âˆ© block 8 busy)= 1 - P(a block is busy for at least one person)^8 We break down the probability of and above by noting that independence between blocks lets us multiply together the probabilities for the individual blocks being busy. Now we have another at least event. At least one person being busy means exactly one person is busy, or both of them are busy. You could use inclusion-exclusion here (probability of or without mutual exclusion, where you need to subtract the intersection), but we could also just take the complement again:= 1 - P(a block is busy for at least one person)^8= 1 - (1 - P(block is free for both people))^8= 1 - (1 - P(person 1 free âˆ© person 2 free))^8= 1 - (1 - P(person is free for one block)^2)^8= 1 - (1 - (1 - 0. 7)^2)^8.

Since the events are independent, we can multiply the probabilities of each person being busy: P(Both busy) = P(Person 1 busy) * P(Person 2 busy) = 0. 7 * 0. 7 = 0. 49 Now, since there are 7 one-hour blocks in a day, the probability that both people are busy in all blocks is: P(Both busy in all blocks) = (0. 49)^7 Now, to find the probability that they are both free in at least one block, we'll subtract the probability that they are both busy in all blocks from the total probability of all possible outcomes, which is 1 since each block can be any state (busy or free) for either person: P(Both free in at least one block) = 1 - P(Both busy in all blocks) = 1 - (0. 49)^7 To get the final answer with 3 decimal places: P(Both free in at least one block) â‰ˆ 1 - 0. 013359 = 0. 986641 So, the probability that there is at least one block of time when they are both free on a given day is approximately 0. 987 (rounded to 3 decimal places).",

To make this problem tractable, they classify movies into specific genres such as 'Tearjerker' or 'Quirky Romance'. The probability that a Netflix user likes a movie $T_i$ from the 'Tearjerker' genre is given by: Given that they like the Tearjerker genre, $p_i = 0. 4$. Given that they do not like the Tearjerker genre, $q_i = 0. 9$. 60% of Netflix users like the Tearjerker genre. Netflix assumes that, given a userâ€™s preference for the genre, liking movie $T_i$ and $T_j$ are conditionally independent events for any movies $i$ and $j$. What is the probability that they like movies $T_1$, $T_2$, or $T_3$ given that they like the Tearjerker genre? Teacher solution: Let $L_i | G$ be the event that they like movie $T_i$ given that they like the Tearjerker genre. The probability that they like at least one of the movies $T_1$, $T_2$, or $T_3$ given that they like the genre is: \\[ \\text{Answer} = P(L_1 | G \\text{ or } L_2 | G \\text{ or } L_3 | G) \\] Using the complement rule: \\[ = 1 - P(L_1^C | G \\text{ and } L_2^C | G \\text{ and } L_3^C | G) \\] Since the events are conditionally independent: \\[ = 1 - (1 - p_1)(1 - p_2)(1 - p_3) \\] An alternative approach uses the inclusion/exclusion principle: \\[ P(L_1 | G \\text{ or } L_2 | G \\text{ or } L_3 | G) = p_1 + p_2 + p_3 - (p_1 p_2) - (p_1 p_3) - (p_2 p_3) + (p_1 p_2 p_3). \\] The Student's Work: To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a fundamental concept in probability theory. Bayes' theorem provides a way to update the probability of a hypothesis based on evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is whether a user likes a given 'Tearjerker' movie, and the evidence is whether the user likes the Tearjerker genre or not. Let's define the following variables: - $P(T_i)$: Probability that a user likes movie $T_i$ - $P(G)$: Probability that a user likes the Tearjerker genre (given as 60%) - $P(\\bar{G})$: Probability that a user does not like the Tearjerker genre (1 - P(G)) - $P(G|T_i)$: Probability that a user likes the Tearjerker genre given that they like movie $T_i$ - $P(G|\\bar{T_i})$: Probability that a user does not like the Tearjerker genre given that they do not like movie $T_i$ We are given that $P(G|T_i) = 0. 4$, $P(\\bar{G}|T_i) = 1. 03$, and $P(G) = 0. 6$. We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate $P(T_i|G)$: $P(T_i|G) = \\frac{P(G|T_i) \\cdot P(T_i)}{P(G)}$ We are asked to assume that, given a userâ€™s preference for the genre, liking movie $T_i$, $T_2$, $T_3$ given that they like the Tearjerker genre. This means that we need to find the probabilities $P(T_2|G)$ and $P(T_3|G)$. Since we are assuming that the movies are independent given the genre preference, we can use the same formula to calculate $P(T_2|G)$ and $P(T_3|G)$: $P(T_2|G) = \\frac{P(G|T_2) \\cdot P(T_2)}{P(G)}$ $P(T_3|G) = \\frac{P(G|T_3) \\cdot P(T_3)}{P(G)}$ Since we are given that $P(G|T_i) = 0. 4$, we can assume that $P(G|T_2) = P(G|T_3) = 0. 4$ as well, since the movies are assumed to be independent given the genre preference. To calculate $P(T_2)$ and $P(T_3)$, we can use the law of total probability: $P(T_2) = P(T_2|G) \\cdot P(G) + P(T_2|\\bar{G}) \\cdot P(\\bar{G})$ $P(T_3) = P(T_3|G) \\cdot P(G) + P(T_3|\\bar{G}) \\cdot P(\\bar{G})$ We are not given the values for $P(T_2|\\bar{G})$ and $P(T_3|\\bar{G})$, but since we are given that $P(\\bar{G}|T_i) = 1. 03$, we can use the fact that $P(\\bar{G}|T_i) + P(G|T_i) = 1$ to find $P(T_i|\\bar{G})$. $P(T_i|\\bar{G}) = 1 - P(G|T_i) = 1 - 0. 4 = 0. 6$ Using this, we can find $P(T_2|\\bar{G})$ and $P(T_3|\\bar{G})$: $P(T_2|\\bar{G}) = P(T_2) - P(T_2|G) \\cdot P(G)$ $P(T_3|\\bar{G}) = P(T_3) - P(T_3|G) \\cdot P(G)$ Now we can calculate $P(T_2|G)$, $P(T_3|G)$, $P(T_2)$, and $P(T_3)$ and find the probabilities that a user likes movies $T_2$ and $T",

First, let's find the probability of a Netflix user liking a 'Tearjerker' movie: P(Like Tearjerker) = 0. 6 (since 60% of Netflix users like the Tearjerker genre) Now, we can find the probability of a user not liking a 'Tearjerker' movie: P(Not Like Tearjerker) = 1 - P(Like Tearjerker) = 1 - 0. 6 = 0. 4 Next, we need to find the conditional probabilities of liking a specific movie given that the user likes or dislikes the Tearjerker genre: P(Like Tearjerker Movie | Like Tearjerker Genre) = p_i = 0. 4 P(Like Tearjerker Movie | Not Like Tearjerker Genre) = q_i = 0. 86 Now, we will assume that the events of liking different movies within the Tearjerker genre are independent given a user's preference for the genre. This means that the probability of liking multiple movies within the Tearjerker genre is the product of the probabilities of liking each movie individually, given their preference for the genre.

The probability of liking a specific movie T_i, given that they like the Tearjerker genre, is: P(T_i | Tearjerker) = p_i = 0. 4 Since the events are independent, the probability of liking multiple movies is the product of the probabilities of liking each movie: P(T_1 and T_2 and T_3 | Tearjerker) = P(T_1 | Tearjerker) * P(T_2 | Tearjerker) * P(T_3 | Tearjerker) = (0. 4) ^ 3 = 0. 064 However, since we are interested in the probability of liking at least one of the movies T_1, T_2, or T_3, we can use the complementary probability: P(T_1 or T_2 or T_3 | Tearjerker) = 1 - P((not T_1 and not T_2 and not T_3) | Tearjerker) Since the events are independent, the probability of not liking a specific movie T_i, given that they like the Tearjerker genre, is: P(not T_i | Tearjerker) = q_i = 0. 9 Now, we can find the probability of not liking all three movies: P((not T_1 and not T_2 and not T_3) | Tearjerker) = P(not T_1 | Tearjerker) * P(not T_2 | Tearjerker) * P(not T_3 | Tearjerker) = (0. 9) ^ 3 = 0. 729 Finally, we can find the probability of liking at least one of the movies T_1, T_2, or T_3 given that they like the Tearjerker genre: P(T_1 or T_2 or T_3 | Tearjerker) = 1 - P((not T_1 and not T_2 and not T_3) | Tearjerker) = 1 - 0. 729 = 0. 271 So, the probability that a Netflix user likes movies T_1, T_2, or T_3 given that they like the Tearjerker genre is approximately 0. 271.",

Information you'll need: Question: When recommending movies, Netflix cares about estimating the probability that a user will like a given movie, based on their viewing history. To make this problem tractable, they classify movies into specific genres such as 'Tearjerker' or 'Quirky Romance'. The probability that a Netflix user likes a movie $T_i$ from the 'Tearjerker' genre is given by: Given that they like the Tearjerker genre, $p_i = 0. 4$. Given that they do not like the Tearjerker genre, $q_i = 0. 9$. 60% of Netflix users like the Tearjerker genre. Netflix assumes that, given a userâ€™s preference for the genre, liking movie $T_i$ and $T_j$ are conditionally independent events for any movies $i$ and $j$. What is the probability that they like movies $T_1$, $T_2$, or $T_3$ given that they like the Tearjerker genre? Teacher solution: Let $L_i | G$ be the event that they like movie $T_i$ given that they like the Tearjerker genre. The probability that they like at least one of the movies $T_1$, $T_2$, or $T_3$ given that they like the genre is: \\[ \\text{Answer} = P(L_1 | G \\text{ or } L_2 | G \\text{ or } L_3 | G) \\] Using the complement rule: \\[ = 1 - P(L_1^C | G \\text{ and } L_2^C | G \\text{ and } L_3^C | G) \\] Since the events are conditionally independent: \\[ = 1 - (1 - p_1)(1 - p_2)(1 - p_3) \\] An alternative approach uses the inclusion/exclusion principle: \\[ P(L_1 | G \\text{ or } L_2 | G \\text{ or } L_3 | G) = p_1 + p_2 + p_3 - (p_1 p_2) - (p_1 p_3) - (p_2 p_3) + (p_1 p_2 p_3). \\] The Student's Work: To find the probability that a user likes movies T_1, T_2, or T_3 given that they like the Tearjerker genre, we can use the law of total probability. Since Netflix assumes that, given a userâ€™s preference for the genre, liking movie T_i and T_j are conditionally independent events for any movies i and j, we can calculate the probability of liking each movie independently and then sum them up. Let P(T_i | Tearjerker) denote the probability that a user likes movie T_i given that they like the Tearjerker genre. Since 60% of Netflix users like the Tearjerker genre, the probability of a randomly selected user liking the Tearjerker genre is 0. 6. The probability of liking a specific movie T_i, given that they like the Tearjerker genre, is: P(T_i | Tearjerker) = p_i = 0. 4 Since the events are independent, the probability of liking multiple movies is the product of the probabilities of liking each movie: P(T_1 and T_2 and T_3 | Tearjerker) = P(T_1 | Tearjerker) * P(T_2 | Tearjerker) * P(T_3 | Tearjerker) = (0. 4) ^ 3 = 0. 064 However, since we are interested in the probability of liking at least one of the movies T_1, T_2, or T_3, we can use the complementary probability: P(T_1 or T_2 or T_3 | Tearjerker) = 1 - P((not T_1 and not T_2 and not T_3) | Tearjerker) Since the events are independent, the probability of not liking a specific movie T_i, given that they like the Tearjerker genre, is: P(not T_i | Tearjerker) = q_i = 0. 9 Now, we can find the probability of not liking all three movies: P((not T_1 and not T_2 and not T_3) | Tearjerker) = P(not T_1 | Tearjerker) * P(not T_2 | Tearjerker) * P(not T_3 | Tearjerker) = (0. 9) ^ 3 = 0. 729 Finally, we can find the probability of liking at least one of the movies T_1, T_2, or T_3 given that they like the Tearjerker genre: P(T_1 or T_2 or T_3 | Tearjerker) = 1 - P((not T_1 and not T_2 and not T_3) | Tearjerker) = 1 - 0. 729 = 0. 271 So, the probability that a Netflix user likes movies T_1, T_2, or T_3 given that they like the Tearjerker genre is approximately 0. 271.",

What is the approximate probability that Program A completes in less time than B? Give an answer to three decimal places. Teacher solution: Let $X_A$ be the running time of program A, and $X_B$ be the running time of program B. Using the Central Limit Theorem, we can find the distributions of $X_A$ and $X_B$: \\[ X_A \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu = 20 \\cdot 50,\\ \\sigma^2 = 20 \\cdot 100) \\] \\[ X_B \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu = 20 \\cdot 52,\\ \\sigma^2 = 20 \\cdot 200) \\] Define a new random variable $X_{A-B}$, representing the difference in running times between program A and program B.

This is because subtracting the two normals is the same as transforming $X_B$ into $(-1) \\cdot X_B$, then adding that to $X_A$. If program A finishes in less time than program B, then $X_{A-B} < 0$. We can calculate the probability of this as: \\[ P(X_{A-B} < 0) = \\Phi\\left( \\frac{0 - (-40)}{\\sqrt{6000}} \\right) = \\Phi(0. 516) \\approx 0. 697 \\] The Student's Work: To solve this problem, we'll use the concept of the comparison of two independent random variables with normal distributions, since the variances are given. First, let's find the standard deviation for each algorithm: 1. Standard Deviation (A) = sqrt(variance) = sqrt(200) â‰ˆ 14. 14 seconds 2.

Information you'll need: Question: How many unique rectangles can you fit in a 9x9 grid? Rectangles can be any size as long as they fit within the grid. Please provide a creative solution rather than brute forcing over sizes. Teacher solution: We can solve this problem by thinking about how to define the bounds of a rectangle using lines on the grid, instead of enumerating all possible sizes. A 9x9 grid has 9 rows and 9 columns, but to define rectangles we consider the horizontal and vertical lines that separate these rows and columns. There are 10 horizontal lines (including the boundaries at the top and bottom) and 10 vertical lines (including the left and right boundaries). To define a rectangle, we select two distinct horizontal lines (to serve as the top and bottom bounds) and two distinct vertical lines (to serve as the left and right bounds). The intersection of these chosen bounds gives us a unique rectangle. The number of ways to choose 2 lines from 10 is given by the binomial coefficient: \\[ \\binom{10}{2} = \\frac{10 \\cdot 9}{2} = 45. \\] Therefore, the total number of unique rectangles is the product of the number of choices for the horizontal and vertical bounds: \\[ \\text{Total Rectangles} = \\binom{10}{2} \\times \\binom{10}{2} = 45 \\times 45 = 2025. \\] This approach creatively avoids enumerating individual rectangle sizes and instead uses a combinatorial argument based on choosing boundary lines. The Student's Work: To solve this problem creatively, let's approach it in a systematic manner by considering the dimensions of the rectangles. We can start by finding the maximum and minimum possible dimensions of the rectangles that can fit within the 9x10 grid. 1. Minimum dimensions: The smallest rectangle that can fit in the grid will be a 1x1 square, but since we want unique rectangles, we'll consider the smallest rectangle that has dimensions greater than 1x1. One such example is a 1x2 rectangle. 2. Maximum dimensions: The largest rectangle that can fit in the grid would be a 9x10 rectangle, but since we don't want the entire grid to be a single rectangle, we'll consider the largest rectangle that has dimensions less than the grid size. One such example is a 8x10 rectangle. Now, to find the number of unique rectangles, we can consider the number of ways to place these rectangles within the grid such that they do not overlap. For rectangles with dimensions 1x2, 2x1, and 2x2, the number of ways to place them is the number of available slots in the grid. Since there are 9 slots in the horizontal direction and 10 slots in the vertical direction, the total number of slots is 9*10 = 90. For rectangles with dimensions greater than 2x2, we can place them by considering the number of ways to choose the starting position (left-top corner) and the number of ways to choose the dimensions of the rectangle. Let's denote the number of unique rectangles with dimensions greater than 2x2 as R. Since there are 9 slots in the horizontal direction and 8 rows are left after placing the smaller rectangles, there are 9 choices for the starting position in the horizontal direction. For each starting position, there are 8 rows left for the height of the rectangle, and 8 columns left for the width, minus one to exclude the starting position itself. So, for each starting position, there are 8*7 = 56 choices for the dimensions of the rectangle. Therefore, the total number of unique rectangles with dimensions greater than 2x2 is 9 * 56 = 504. Finally, the total number of unique rectangles is the sum of the number of smaller rectangles and the number of larger rectangles: Total rectangles = (90 for smaller rectangles) + (504 for larger rectangles) = 594 So, there are 594 unique rectangles that can fit in a 9x10 grid.",

There are two ways this can happen: (1) both shapes are squares, or (2) both shapes are triangles. Define $A$ as the event of selecting two squares, and $B$ as the event of selecting two triangles. These two events are mutually exclusive. The number of ways to choose two squares is \\[ |A| = 6 \\times 6 = 36 \\] since there are 6 squares and we choose one twice (with replacement).

Expected running time for Program A: Since Program A runs 20 algorithms in sequence, the total expected running time is 20 * 53 = 1060 seconds (approximately 17. 67 minutes). The variance of the running time is 110 seconds^2. 2. Expected running time for Program B: Each algorithm in Program B has a mean of 53 seconds and a variance of 221 seconds^2. Since Program B runs 18 algorithms, the total expected running time is 18 * 53 = 954 seconds (approximately 15. 9 minutes).

Comparing the two: To find the probability that Program A completes in less time than B, we need to find the probability that the running time for Program B exceeds the running time for Program A. Since the running times for each algorithm in Program B are independent random variables, we can find the CDF of the total running time for Program B and compare it to the running time for Program A. The CDF of a normally distributed random variable X with mean Î¼ and variance Ïƒ^2 is: CDF(X â‰¤ x) = P(X â‰¤ x) = Î¦((x - Î¼) / Ïƒ), where Î¦ is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution.

Information you'll need: Question: Imagine you have a population of 1 million infectious bacteria in your gut, 10% of which have a mutation that makes them slightly more resistant to antibiotics. You take a course of antibiotics. The probability that bacteria with the mutation survive is 20%. The probability that bacteria without the mutation survive is 1%. What is the probability that a randomly chosen bacterium survives the antibiotics? Teacher solution: Let $E$ be the event that a bacterium survives. Let $M$ be the event that a bacterium has the mutation. By the Law of Total Probability (LOTP): \\[ P(E) = P(E \\text{ and } M) + P(E \\text{ and } M^C) \\] Applying the Chain Rule: \\[ P(E) = P(E|M)P(M) + P(E|M^C)P(M^C) \\] Substituting the given values: \\[ P(E) = 0. 20 \\cdot 0. 10 + 0. 01 \\cdot 0. 90 \\] \\[ P(E) = 0. 029 \\] Therefore, the probability that a randomly chosen bacterium survives the antibiotics is 0. 029. The Student's Work: To solve this problem, we will use the concept of conditional probability. Let's denote: - P(M) as the probability that a bacterium has the mutation (11% or 0. 11) - P(S|M) as the probability that a bacterium with the mutation survives the antibiotics (20% or 0. 20) - P(S|~M) as the probability that a bacterium without the mutation survives the antibiotics (1% or 0. 01) - P(S) as the probability that a randomly chosen bacterium survives the antibiotics We know that the population is made up of bacteria with the mutation and bacteria without the mutation, so: P(M) + P(~M) = 1 0. 11 + P(~M) = 1 P(~M) = 1 - 0. 11 = 0. 89 Now, we can calculate the probability of a randomly chosen bacterium surviving the antibiotics by multiplying the probabilities of it not having the mutation and surviving (given it doesn't have the mutation) and the probability of it having the mutation and surviving (given it has the mutation), and then adding these two probabilities together. P(S) = P(~M) * P(S|~M) + P(M) * P(S|M) P(S) = 0. 89 * 0. 01 + 0. 11 * 0. 20 P(S) = 0. 00089 + 0. 022 = 0. 02289 or approximately 2. 29% (rounded to two decimal places) So, the probability that a randomly chosen bacterium survives the antibiotics is approximately 2. 29%.",

We assume that whether each block is busy for a person is independent of whether other blocks are busy for them, and also independent of whether that block is busy for other people. Question: Two people are trying to schedule a meeting. What is the probability that there is at least one block of time when they are both free on a given day? Provide an answer to 3 decimal places. Teacher solution: Solving this problem requires us to recognize how helpful it is to take the complement a few times. First, since we are looking for the probability that at least one block of time is free for both people, we can simplify our calculations by taking the complement of at least one and instead finding one minus the probability that all blocks of time are busy for at least one of the two people. P(1+ time free for both) = 1 - P(all times busy)= 1 - P(block 1 busy âˆ© block 2 busy âˆ© . . . âˆ© block 8 busy)= 1 - P(a block is busy for at least one person)^8 We break down the probability of and above by noting that independence between blocks lets us multiply together the probabilities for the individual blocks being busy.

You could use inclusion-exclusion here (probability of or without mutual exclusion, where you need to subtract the intersection), but we could also just take the complement again:= 1 - P(a block is busy for at least one person)^8= 1 - (1 - P(block is free for both people))^8= 1 - (1 - P(person 1 free âˆ© person 2 free))^8= 1 - (1 - P(person is free for one block)^2)^8= 1 - (1 - (1 - 0. 7)^2)^8.

You take a course of antibiotics. The probability that bacteria with the mutation survive is 20%. The probability that bacteria without the mutation survive is 1%. What is the probability that a randomly chosen bacterium survives the antibiotics? Teacher solution: Let $E$ be the event that a bacterium survives. Let $M$ be the event that a bacterium has the mutation. By the Law of Total Probability (LOTP): \\[ P(E) = P(E \\text{ and } M) + P(E \\text{ and } M^C) \\] Applying the Chain Rule: \\[ P(E) = P(E|M)P(M) + P(E|M^C)P(M^C) \\] Substituting the given values: \\[ P(E) = 0. 20 \\cdot 0. 10 + 0. 01 \\cdot 0. 90 \\] \\[ P(E) = 0. 029 \\] Therefore, the probability that a randomly chosen bacterium survives the antibiotics is 0. 029. The Student's Work: To find the probability that a randomly chosen bacterium survives the antibiotics, we first need to find the probability of choosing a bacterium with the mutation and then find the probability of that bacterium surviving, as well as the probability of choosing a bacterium without the mutation and finding it surviving. We can then add these two probabilities together, as they are mutually exclusive events (either the bacterium has the mutation or it doesn't). Let's denote the probability of choosing a bacterium with the mutation as P(M), the probability of survival for bacteria with the mutation as S(M), and the probability of choosing a bacterium without the mutation as P(NM). The probability of survival for bacteria without the mutation is S(NM). Given that 10% of the bacteria have the mutation, we have: P(M) = 0. 1 Since 20% of bacteria with the mutation survive, we have: S(M) = 0. 2 Since 90% of the bacteria do not have the mutation, we have: P(NM) = 0. 9 Since only 1% of bacteria without the mutation survive, we have: S(NM) = 0. 01 Now we can calculate the probability of choosing a bacterium and finding it surviving: P(surviving) = P(M) * S(M) + P(NM) * S(NM) P(surviving) = (0. 1 * 0. 2) + (0. 9 * 0. 01) P(surviving) = 0. 02 + 0. 009 P(surviving) = 0. 029 So, the probability that a randomly chosen bacterium survives the antibiotics is approximately 2. 9%.",

Information you'll need: Question: Imagine you have a population of 1 million infectious bacteria in your gut, 10% of which have a mutation that makes them slightly more resistant to antibiotics. You take a course of antibiotics. The probability that bacteria with the mutation survive is 20%. The probability that bacteria without the mutation survive is 1%. What is the probability that a randomly chosen bacterium survives the antibiotics? Teacher solution: Let $E$ be the event that a bacterium survives. Let $M$ be the event that a bacterium has the mutation. By the Law of Total Probability (LOTP): \\[ P(E) = P(E \\text{ and } M) + P(E \\text{ and } M^C) \\] Applying the Chain Rule: \\[ P(E) = P(E|M)P(M) + P(E|M^C)P(M^C) \\] Substituting the given values: \\[ P(E) = 0. 20 \\cdot 0. 10 + 0. 01 \\cdot 0. 90 \\] \\[ P(E) = 0. 029 \\] Therefore, the probability that a randomly chosen bacterium survives the antibiotics is 0. 029. The Student's Work: To find the probability that a randomly chosen bacterium survives the antibiotics, we first need to find the probability of choosing a bacterium with the mutation and then find the probability of that bacterium surviving, as well as the probability of choosing a bacterium without the mutation and finding it surviving. We can then add these two probabilities together, as they are mutually exclusive events (either the bacterium has the mutation or it doesn't). Let's denote the probability of choosing a bacterium with the mutation as P(M), the probability of survival for bacteria with the mutation as S(M), and the probability of choosing a bacterium without the mutation as P(NM). The probability of survival for bacteria without the mutation is S(NM). Given that 10% of the bacteria have the mutation, we have: P(M) = 0. 1 Since 20% of bacteria with the mutation survive, we have: S(M) = 0. 2 Since 90% of the bacteria do not have the mutation, we have: P(NM) = 0. 9 Since only 1% of bacteria without the mutation survive, we have: S(NM) = 0. 01 Now we can calculate the probability of choosing a bacterium and finding it surviving: P(surviving) = P(M) * S(M) + P(NM) * S(NM) P(surviving) = (0. 1 * 0. 2) + (0. 9 * 0. 01) P(surviving) = 0. 02 + 0. 009 P(surviving) = 0. 029 So, the probability that a randomly chosen bacterium survives the antibiotics is approximately 2. 9%.",

Information you'll need: Question: Stanford's HCI class runs a massive online class that was taken by ten thousand students. The class used peer assessment to evaluate student work. In the class, each student has their work evaluated by 5 peers, and every student is asked to evaluate 6 assignments: five peers and one control assignment (graders were unaware of which assignment was the control). All 10,000 students evaluated the same control assignment, and the scores they gave are in the file peerGrades. csv. Would you use the mean or the median of 5 peer grades to assign scores in the online version of Stanford's HCI class? Explain why. You may use simulations to solve any part of this question. Hint: it might help to visualize the scores in peerGrades. csv. In order to make your decision compute the statistics in part a) and b). a) Mean of Grades Students could be given a final score which is the mean of the 5 grades given by their peers. Imagine the control experiment had only received 5 peer-grades. What is the variance of the mean of those five grades? Succinctly describe how you calculated your answer. b) Median of Grades Students could be given a final score which is the median of the 5 grades given by their peers. Imagine the control experiment had only received 5 peer-grades. What is the variance of the median grade that the control experiment would have been given? Succinctly describe how you calculated your answer. Enter your estimate of the variance to 1 decimal place as your numeric answer. Teacher solution: First, here's a simple way of loading in the data from the file: ```python with open(filepath, 'r') as f: grades = [int(line) for line in f] ``` We want to simulate the process of taking the mean of 5 grades, over and over, so that we can get an estimate of how much that mean-of-5 varies, depending on the spread of the values in the overall dataset. This is analogous to bootstrapping! To determine this \"variance of the mean,\" we just sample 5 grades, take the mean, and repeat, and then take the variance of all of those means. ```python means = [] for i in range(10000): sample = np. random. choice(grades, 5, replace=True) means. append(np. mean(sample)) print(np. var(means)) ``` The variance of the mean is 101. 26. Note that with fewer iterations for the for loop, you might get a number that varies run-to-run. For part b, we repeat this process, but take the median instead of the mean inside the for loop. The variance of the median is 56. 021. You could conclude that the median is better simply because it has a lower variance. A better argument can be made by looking at the histogram of grades given to the control experiment, which shows that there are extreme outliers in the distribution that would skew the mean, but not the median. The Student's Work: a) Mean of Grades: To find the variance of the mean of five grades, we first need to calculate the variance of a single grade. Let's assume the grades are normally distributed with mean Î¼ and standard deviation Ïƒ. The variance of a single grade is Ïƒ^2. Now, if we take the mean of five grades, the mean of the means (denoted as Î¼_mean) would be the same as Î¼ because the mean of normally distributed data remains the same regardless of the number of samples. The variance of the mean (denoted as Ïƒ^2_mean) is given by the formula Ïƒ^2_mean = Ïƒ^2 / n, where n is the number of samples. In our case, n = 5. So, Ïƒ^2_mean = Ïƒ^2 / 5. b) Median of Grades: The median of five grades is the middle value when the grades are arranged in ascending order. Since the data is assumed to be normally distributed, the median of five grades would be approximately the same as the mean of five grades (as the mean and median are close for normal distributions with a large number of samples). However, the variance of the median is a bit more complex to calculate. For large sample sizes, the variance of the median (denoted as Ïƒ^2_median) can be approximated by the formula Ï€ / (n * (n + 1)). So, for n = 5, Ïƒ^2_median = Ï€ / (5 * (5 + 1)) = 0. 47727 (rounded to one decimal place). In summary: a) The variance of the mean of five grades is Ïƒ^2 / 5. b) The variance of the median of five grades is approximately 0. 477 (rounded to one decimal place). These calculations assume that the grades are normally distributed, which may not be the case in reality.

Information you'll need: Question: When recommending movies, Netflix cares about estimating the probability that a user will like a given movie, based on their viewing history. To make this problem tractable, they classify movies into specific genres such as 'Tearjerker' or 'Quirky Romance'. The probability that a Netflix user likes a movie $T_i$ from the 'Tearjerker' genre is given by: Given that they like the Tearjerker genre, $p_i = 0. 4$. Given that they do not like the Tearjerker genre, $q_i = 0. 9$. 60% of Netflix users like the Tearjerker genre. Netflix assumes that, given a userâ€™s preference for the genre, liking movie $T_i$ and $T_j$ are conditionally independent events for any movies $i$ and $j$. What is the probability that they like movies $T_1$, $T_2$, or $T_3$ given that they like the Tearjerker genre? Teacher solution: Let $L_i | G$ be the event that they like movie $T_i$ given that they like the Tearjerker genre.

Information you'll need: Question: Stanford's HCI class runs a massive online class that was taken by ten thousand students. The class used peer assessment to evaluate student work. In the class, each student has their work evaluated by 5 peers, and every student is asked to evaluate 6 assignments: five peers and one control assignment (graders were unaware of which assignment was the control). All 10,000 students evaluated the same control assignment, and the scores they gave are in the file peerGrades. csv. Would you use the mean or the median of 5 peer grades to assign scores in the online version of Stanford's HCI class? Explain why. You may use simulations to solve any part of this question. Hint: it might help to visualize the scores in peerGrades. csv. In order to make your decision compute the statistics in part a) and b). a) Mean of Grades Students could be given a final score which is the mean of the 5 grades given by their peers. Imagine the control experiment had only received 5 peer-grades. What is the variance of the mean of those five grades? Succinctly describe how you calculated your answer. b) Median of Grades Students could be given a final score which is the median of the 5 grades given by their peers. Imagine the control experiment had only received 5 peer-grades. What is the variance of the median grade that the control experiment would have been given? Succinctly describe how you calculated your answer. Enter your estimate of the variance to 1 decimal place as your numeric answer. Teacher solution: First, here's a simple way of loading in the data from the file: ```python with open(filepath, 'r') as f: grades = [int(line) for line in f] ``` We want to simulate the process of taking the mean of 5 grades, over and over, so that we can get an estimate of how much that mean-of-5 varies, depending on the spread of the values in the overall dataset. This is analogous to bootstrapping! To determine this \"variance of the mean,\" we just sample 5 grades, take the mean, and repeat, and then take the variance of all of those means. ```python means = [] for i in range(10000): sample = np. random. choice(grades, 5, replace=True) means. append(np. mean(sample)) print(np. var(means)) ``` The variance of the mean is 101. 26. Note that with fewer iterations for the for loop, you might get a number that varies run-to-run. For part b, we repeat this process, but take the median instead of the mean inside the for loop. The variance of the median is 56. 021. You could conclude that the median is better simply because it has a lower variance. A better argument can be made by looking at the histogram of grades given to the control experiment, which shows that there are extreme outliers in the distribution that would skew the mean, but not the median. The Student's Work: a) Mean of Grades: To find the variance of the mean of five grades, we first need to understand the variance of a single grade. Let's assume the variance of a single grade is ÏƒÂ² (sigma-square). Since the mean is the sum of the grades divided by 5, the variance of the mean will be smaller due to averaging. The formula for the variance of the mean is ÏƒÂ²/n, where n is the number of grades being averaged. In this case, n = 5. So, the variance of the mean of five grades would be ÏƒÂ²/5. However, we don't have the actual data, so we can't calculate the exact variance. But we can simulate the scenario to understand the concept. Let's assume a hypothetical ÏƒÂ² = 100 (for simplicity). The variance of the mean would be 100/5 = 20. b) Median of Grades: The median is less sensitive to outliers than the mean, so the variance of the median grade would be expected to be smaller. Calculating the exact variance of the median of a sample (in this case, n = 5) from a population is complex due to the distribution shape and the sample size. However, for large samples, the variance of the median is approximately ÏƒÂ²/(9n). Again, using our hypothetical ÏƒÂ² = 100, the variance of the median grade would be approximately 100/(9*5) = 11. 11 (to 1 decimal place). In practice, it's common to use the mean for continuous data when data points are independent and normally distributed, and the median for continuous data when data points are skewed or when the distribution is unknown. For this problem, both the mean and median could be used, but the mean might be more appropriate given the nature of the scores and the large sample size. However, using the median might help reduce the impact of extreme scores, which could be useful in certain contexts. It's important to note that the actual choice would depend on the specific goals and requirements of the evaluation process. In the given scenario, the control assignment was evaluated by 10,000 students, so the number of peer grades (5) is a relatively small portion of the total grades. In such a case, using the mean would likely be more appropriate, as it would provide a more accurate representation of the average score. The median might be useful if there were concerns about outliers, but in this case, those concerns would be mitigated by the large number of scores. In a real-world scenario, it would be best to analyze the distribution of scores and consider the specific goals and requirements of the evaluation process to determine the most appropriate scoring method. Additionally, it would be important to consider any potential biases in the grading process and to take steps to mitigate them.",

Information you'll need: Question: Program A will run 20 algorithms in sequence, with the running time for each algorithm being independent random variables with mean = 50 seconds and variance = 100 seconds$^2$. Program B will run 20 algorithms in sequence, with the running time for each algorithm being independent random variables with mean = 52 seconds and variance = 200 seconds$^2$. What is the approximate probability that Program A completes in less time than B? Give an answer to three decimal places. Teacher solution: Let $X_A$ be the running time of program A, and $X_B$ be the running time of program B. Using the Central Limit Theorem, we can find the distributions of $X_A$ and $X_B$: \\[ X_A \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu = 20 \\cdot 50,\\ \\sigma^2 = 20 \\cdot 100) \\] \\[ X_B \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu = 20 \\cdot 52,\\ \\sigma^2 = 20 \\cdot 200) \\] Define a new random variable $X_{A-B}$, representing the difference in running times between program A and program B. Since the sum or difference between two normal random variables is also normal: \\[ X_{A-B} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu = 1000 - 1040,\\ \\sigma^2 = 2000 + 4000) \\] \\[ X_{A-B} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(-40,\\ 6000) \\] Note that we subtract the means, but add the variances. This is because subtracting the two normals is the same as transforming $X_B$ into $(-1) \\cdot X_B$, then adding that to $X_A$. If program A finishes in less time than program B, then $X_{A-B} < 0$. We can calculate the probability of this as: \\[ P(X_{A-B} < 0) = \\Phi\\left( \\frac{0 - (-40)}{\\sqrt{6000}} \\right) = \\Phi(0. 516) \\approx 0. 697 \\] The Student's Work: To solve this problem, we'll first find the expected running time for each algorithm in both Program A and Program B, and then find the distribution of the total running time for each program. After that, we can compare the expected total running times and use the cumulative distribution function (CDF) to find the probability that Program A completes in less time than B. 1. Expected running time for each algorithm in Program A: Mean = 50 seconds So, the expected running time for one algorithm in Program A is 50 seconds. 2. Expected running time for each algorithm in Program B: Mean = 52 seconds So, the expected running time for one algorithm in Program B is 52 seconds. 3. Total running time for each program: Program A runs 1 algorithm, so the total running time is 50 seconds. Program B runs 20 algorithms, so the total running time is 20 * 52 = 1040 seconds (17 minutes and 0 seconds). 4. Variance for each algorithm: Program A: variance = 100 seconds^2 Program B: variance = 200 seconds^2 5. Total variance for each program: Program A: total variance = 100 seconds^2 (since it runs only 1 algorithm) Program B: total variance = 200 * 20 = 4000 seconds^2 (or 1 hour and 40 minutes of variance) 6. Standard deviation for each algorithm: Program A: standard deviation = sqrt(100) â‰ˆ 10 seconds Program B: standard deviation = sqrt(4000) â‰ˆ 63. 24 seconds 7. Standard deviation for total running time for each program: Program A: total standard deviation = 10 seconds (since it runs only 1 algorithm) Program B: total standard deviation = sqrt(4000) * sqrt(20) â‰ˆ 208. 68 seconds (or 3 minutes and 29 seconds) 8. Approximate distribution of total running time for each program: Since the running times are normally distributed, the total running time for each program will also be normally distributed. We can use the z-score formula to find the approximate z-scores for the expected total running times: Z-score for Program A = (expected running time - mean) / standard deviation Z-score for Program A = (50 - 50) / 10 = 0 Z-score for Program B = (expected running time - mean) / standard deviation Z-score for Program B = (1040 - 50) / 208. 68 â‰ˆ 4. 96 Now, we can use a z-table to find the cumulative probability for each z-score: P(Z <= 0) for Program A = 0. 5 P(Z <= 4. 96) for Program B â‰ˆ 0. 9999997 (nearly certain) 9. Probability that Program A completes in less time than B: P(Program A completes in less time than B) = P(Z <= 0 for Program A) - P(Z <= 4. 96 for Program B) P(Program A completes in less time than B) = 0. 5 - 0. 9999997 â‰ˆ 0. 0000003 So, the approximate probability that Program A completes in less time than B is 0. 000, which is essentially zero.

Using the Central Limit Theorem, we can find the distributions of $X_A$ and $X_B$: \\[ X_A \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu = 20 \\cdot 50,\\ \\sigma^2 = 20 \\cdot 100) \\] \\[ X_B \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu = 20 \\cdot 52,\\ \\sigma^2 = 20 \\cdot 200) \\] Define a new random variable $X_{A-B}$, representing the difference in running times between program A and program B. Since the sum or difference between two normal random variables is also normal: \\[ X_{A-B} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu = 1000 - 1040,\\ \\sigma^2 = 2000 + 4000) \\] \\[ X_{A-B} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(-40,\\ 6000) \\] Note that we subtract the means, but add the variances. This is because subtracting the two normals is the same as transforming $X_B$ into $(-1) \\cdot X_B$, then adding that to $X_A$. If program A finishes in less time than program B, then $X_{A-B} < 0$. We can calculate the probability of this as: \\[ P(X_{A-B} < 0) = \\Phi\\left( \\frac{0 - (-40)}{\\sqrt{6000}} \\right) = \\Phi(0. 516) \\approx 0. 697 \\] The Student's Work: To solve this problem, we'll first find the expected running time for each algorithm in both Program A and Program B, and then find the distribution of the total running time for each program. After that, we can compare the expected total running times and use the cumulative distribution function (CDF) to find the probability that Program A completes in less time than B. 1. Expected running time for each algorithm in Program A: Mean = 50 seconds So, the expected running time for one algorithm in Program A is 50 seconds. 2. Expected running time for each algorithm in Program B: Mean = 52 seconds So, the expected running time for one algorithm in Program B is 52 seconds. 3. Total running time for each program: Program A runs 1 algorithm, so the total running time is 50 seconds. Program B runs 20 algorithms, so the total running time is 20 * 52 = 1040 seconds (17 minutes and 0 seconds). 4. Variance for each algorithm: Program A: variance = 100 seconds^2 Program B: variance = 200 seconds^2 5. Total variance for each program: Program A: total variance = 100 seconds^2 (since it runs only 1 algorithm) Program B: total variance = 200 * 20 = 4000 seconds^2 (or 1 hour and 40 minutes of variance) 6. Standard deviation for each algorithm: Program A: standard deviation = sqrt(100) â‰ˆ 10 seconds Program B: standard deviation = sqrt(4000) â‰ˆ 63. 24 seconds 7. Standard deviation for total running time for each program: Program A: total standard deviation = 10 seconds (since it runs only 1 algorithm) Program B: total standard deviation = sqrt(4000) * sqrt(20) â‰ˆ 208. 68 seconds (or 3 minutes and 29 seconds) 8. Approximate distribution of total running time for each program: Since the running times are normally distributed, the total running time for each program will also be normally distributed. We can use the z-score formula to find the approximate z-scores for the expected total running times: Z-score for Program A = (expected running time - mean) / standard deviation Z-score for Program A = (50 - 50) / 10 = 0 Z-score for Program B = (expected running time - mean) / standard deviation Z-score for Program B = (1040 - 50) / 208. 68 â‰ˆ 4. 96 Now, we can use a z-table to find the cumulative probability for each z-score: P(Z <= 0) for Program A = 0. 5 P(Z <= 4. 96) for Program B â‰ˆ 0. 9999997 (nearly certain) 9. Probability that Program A completes in less time than B: P(Program A completes in less time than B) = P(Z <= 0 for Program A) - P(Z <= 4. 96 for Program B) P(Program A completes in less time than B) = 0. 5 - 0. 9999997 â‰ˆ 0. 0000003 So, the approximate probability that Program A completes in less time than B is 0. 000, which is essentially zero. It is almost certain that Program B will complete in less time than Program A.",

Now we want to find the probability that Program A completes in less time than Program B. We can do this by finding the CDF of Program A and subtracting the CDF of Program B: CDF of Program A = P(X <= t) = P(number of algorithms completed <= t * 20) Here, X is the running time of a single algorithm in seconds. Since the running times are independent and follow a normal distribution, the CDF of the total running time will also follow a normal distribution.

A wire cannot connect a letter to itself, and the wires are indistinct (e. g. , a wire connecting 'K' to 'L' is the same as one connecting 'L' to 'K'). How many ways are there to place exactly three wires connecting pairs of letters, given that there are 26 letters in total?

However, because the wires are indistinct, we have overcounted each arrangement by the number of permutations of the three wires (which is $3! $). Therefore, the total number of ways is: \\[ \\text{Total} = \\frac{ \\binom{26}{2} \\cdot \\binom{24}{2} \\cdot \\binom{22}{2} }{3! } = 3,453,450. \\] An alternative way to arrive at the same answer is as follows: First, select the six letters that will be wired (since three wires connect six letters), which can be done in \\( \\binom{26}{6} \\) ways.

But this overcounts in two ways: (1) by a factor of $3! $ for the ordering of the three pairs, and (2) by a factor of $2^3$ because the ordering within each pair does not matter.

However, since the plug board is symmetric (meaning that swapping A with B is the same as swapping B with A), we can divide this number by 2. So, the total number of possible unique wire connections is (26 choose 2) / 2 = 325 connections.

Information you'll need: Question: The Enigma machine used by the Nazis in WW2 had a plug board where wires could swap the electrical signal for letters. A wire cannot connect a letter to itself, and the wires are indistinct (e. g. , a wire connecting 'K' to 'L' is the same as one connecting 'L' to 'K'). How many ways are there to place exactly three wires connecting pairs of letters, given that there are 26 letters in total? Teacher solution: There are \\( \\binom{26}{2} \\) ways to place the first wire, \\( \\binom{24}{2} \\) ways to place the second wire, and \\( \\binom{22}{2} \\) ways to place the third wire.

Information you'll need: Question: You are trying to find a time when two people can meet. Assume a day is composed of 8 one hour blocks. Each block has $p = 0. 7$ probability of being busy for each person. We assume that whether each block is busy for a person is independent of whether other blocks are busy for them, and also independent of whether that block is busy for other people. Question: Two people are trying to schedule a meeting. What is the probability that there is at least one block of time when they are both free on a given day? Provide an answer to 3 decimal places. Teacher solution: Solving this problem requires us to recognize how helpful it is to take the complement a few times. First, since we are looking for the probability that at least one block of time is free for both people, we can simplify our calculations by taking the complement of at least one and instead finding one minus the probability that all blocks of time are busy for at least one of the two people. P(1+ time free for both) = 1 - P(all times busy)= 1 - P(block 1 busy âˆ© block 2 busy âˆ© . . . âˆ© block 8 busy)= 1 - P(a block is busy for at least one person)^8 We break down the probability of and above by noting that independence between blocks lets us multiply together the probabilities for the individual blocks being busy. Now we have another at least event. At least one person being busy means exactly one person is busy, or both of them are busy. You could use inclusion-exclusion here (probability of or without mutual exclusion, where you need to subtract the intersection), but we could also just take the complement again:= 1 - P(a block is busy for at least one person)^8= 1 - (1 - P(block is free for both people))^8= 1 - (1 - P(person 1 free âˆ© person 2 free))^8= 1 - (1 - P(person is free for one block)^2)^8= 1 - (1 - (1 - 0. 7)^2)^8. Above, we used independence between people to break down a probability of and into the product of the probability that one person is free for a particular block, and finally, we plugged in the complement of the probability that a person is busy for one block. The Student's Work: To find the probability that both people are free in at least one block of time, we can use the complementary probability approach. Instead of finding the probability that both people are free in every block and subtracting it from 1 (which would be a very complex calculation due to the large number of cases), we'll find the probability that both people are busy in every block and subtract it from 1. Let A be the event that Person 1 is busy in a given block, and B be the event that Person 2 is busy in a given block. Since the events are independent, the probability of both A and B happening is P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B) = (0. 7) * (0. 7) = 0. 49. Since there are 8 blocks in a day, the probability that both people are busy in all blocks is (0. 49)^8. Now, to find the probability that both people are free in at least one block, we subtract the probability that both people are busy in all blocks from 1: P(at least one free block) = 1 - P(both busy in all blocks) = 1 - (0. 49)^8 = 0. 9999814.

Information you'll need: Question: How many unique rectangles can you fit in a 9x9 grid? Rectangles can be any size as long as they fit within the grid. Please provide a creative solution rather than brute forcing over sizes. Teacher solution: We can solve this problem by thinking about how to define the bounds of a rectangle using lines on the grid, instead of enumerating all possible sizes. A 9x9 grid has 9 rows and 9 columns, but to define rectangles we consider the horizontal and vertical lines that separate these rows and columns. There are 10 horizontal lines (including the boundaries at the top and bottom) and 10 vertical lines (including the left and right boundaries). To define a rectangle, we select two distinct horizontal lines (to serve as the top and bottom bounds) and two distinct vertical lines (to serve as the left and right bounds). The intersection of these chosen bounds gives us a unique rectangle. The number of ways to choose 2 lines from 10 is given by the binomial coefficient: \\[ \\binom{10}{2} = \\frac{10 \\cdot 9}{2} = 45. \\] Therefore, the total number of unique rectangles is the product of the number of choices for the horizontal and vertical bounds: \\[ \\text{Total Rectangles} = \\binom{10}{2} \\times \\binom{10}{2} = 45 \\times 45 = 2025. \\] This approach creatively avoids enumerating individual rectangle sizes and instead uses a combinatorial argument based on choosing boundary lines. The Student's Work: To find the number of unique rectangles that can fit within a 9x9 grid, we can approach this problem by considering the number of ways to choose the dimensions (width and height) of the rectangles. Let's denote the width of the rectangle as w and the height as h. Since the rectangle must fit within the grid, we have the following constraints: 1. w and h are positive integers such that w <= 9 and h <= 9 2. The area of the rectangle (wh) must be less than or equal to the area of the grid (9x9), which gives us the condition: wh <= 81 To count the number of unique rectangles, we can start by finding the number of unique pairs (w, h) that satisfy the conditions. Since the grid is symmetric, we only need to consider the upper-left quadrant (0, 0) to (9, 9) and the diagonal from (0, 0) to (9, 9). We can generate all possible pairs (w, h) in the upper-left quadrant and on the diagonal using a loop. For each pair, we check if the area (wh) is less than or equal to 81. If it is, we have a valid rectangle, and we can increment a counter. Here is a Python code snippet to demonstrate this approach: ```python def count_rectangles(n): count = 0 for w in range(1, n+1): for h in range(w, n+1): if w * h > 81: break if w * h <= 81: count += 1 return count * 4 # Multiply by 4 to account for the symmetry print(count_rectangles(9)) # Output: 121 ``` This solution runs in O(n^2) time complexity, which is efficient enough for small grid sizes like 9x9.

Hint: it might help to visualize the scores in peerGrades. csv. In order to make your decision compute the statistics in part a) and b). a) Mean of Grades Students could be given a final score which is the mean of the 5 grades given by their peers. Imagine the control experiment had only received 5 peer-grades. What is the variance of the mean of those five grades? Succinctly describe how you calculated your answer. b) Median of Grades Students could be given a final score which is the median of the 5 grades given by their peers. Imagine the control experiment had only received 5 peer-grades. What is the variance of the median grade that the control experiment would have been given? Succinctly describe how you calculated your answer. Enter your estimate of the variance to 1 decimal place as your numeric answer. Teacher solution: First, here's a simple way of loading in the data from the file: ```python with open(filepath, 'r') as f: grades = [int(line) for line in f] ``` We want to simulate the process of taking the mean of 5 grades, over and over, so that we can get an estimate of how much that mean-of-5 varies, depending on the spread of the values in the overall dataset. This is analogous to bootstrapping! To determine this \"variance of the mean,\" we just sample 5 grades, take the mean, and repeat, and then take the variance of all of those means. ```python means = [] for i in range(10000): sample = np. random. choice(grades, 5, replace=True) means. append(np. mean(sample)) print(np. var(means)) ``` The variance of the mean is 101. 26. Note that with fewer iterations for the for loop, you might get a number that varies run-to-run. For part b, we repeat this process, but take the median instead of the mean inside the for loop. The variance of the median is 56. 021. You could conclude that the median is better simply because it has a lower variance. A better argument can be made by looking at the histogram of grades given to the control experiment, which shows that there are extreme outliers in the distribution that would skew the mean, but not the median. The Student's Work: a) Mean of Grades: To find the variance of the mean of 5 grades, we first need to calculate the variance of the individual grades and then apply the formula for the variance of the mean. Let's assume the 5 grades for the control assignment are x1, x2, x3, x4, x5. The variance of a single grade (x) is: Var(x) = E[(x - E[x])^2] Since we have 5 grades, we'll find the mean of the grades first: E[x] = (x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 + x5) / 5 Now we calculate the variance of a single grade: Var(x) = [(x1 - E[x])^2 + (x2 - E[x])^2 + (x3 - E[x])^2 + (x4 - E[x])^2 + (x5 - E[x])^2] / 5 However, since we don't have the actual grades, we can't find the exact variance. But we can simulate this by generating random grades and calculating the variance of the mean. Let's generate 10,000 sets of 5 grades (each set is between 1 and 100): ```python import random grades = [random. randint(1, 100) for _ in range(10000)] groups = [grades[i:i+5] for i in range(0, len(grades), 5)] mean_of_5_grades = [sum(group) / 5 for group in groups] variance_of_mean = sum((mean - sum(mean_of_5_grades) / len(mean_of_5_grades)) ** 2 for mean in mean_of_5_grades) / (len(mean_of_5_grades - 1) * 5) print(variance_of_mean) ``` The output will be an estimate of the variance of the mean of 5 grades. b) Median of Grades: To find the variance of the median grade, we'll use the concept of the Bessel's correction. The Bessel's correction adjusts the variance of a sample mean to account for the sample size. For the median, we can't directly calculate the variance because the median is not a random variable. However, we can use the following approximation: Variance of the median (estimate) = (Var(X) / n) * (1. 32832) Here, n is the sample size (5) and X is the population from which the sample is drawn. Since we don't have the actual grades, we can't find the exact variance of the grades. But we can use the same simulation as in part a) to get an estimate of Var(X). Simulate the variance of the median grade: ```python # Simulate the variance of the median grade variance_of_median = (variance_of_mean * 1. 32832) / 5 print(variance_of_median) ``` This will give you an estimate of the variance of the median grade. In summary, using the mean of 5 peer grades could potentially lead to a lower variance in scores since the mean is less affected by outliers compared to the median. However, the median might be more robust against extreme outliers. The choice between mean and median would depend on the specific distribution of the grades and the importance of outlier resistance in the context of the class. The simulation results provide an estimate of the variance for both methods, which can help in making an informed decision.",

Information you'll need: Question: Program A will run 20 algorithms in sequence, with the running time for each algorithm being independent random variables with mean = 50 seconds and variance = 100 seconds$^2$. Program B will run 20 algorithms in sequence, with the running time for each algorithm being independent random variables with mean = 52 seconds and variance = 200 seconds$^2$. What is the approximate probability that Program A completes in less time than B? Give an answer to three decimal places. Teacher solution: Let $X_A$ be the running time of program A, and $X_B$ be the running time of program B. Using the Central Limit Theorem, we can find the distributions of $X_A$ and $X_B$: \\[ X_A \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu = 20 \\cdot 50,\\ \\sigma^2 = 20 \\cdot 100) \\] \\[ X_B \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu = 20 \\cdot 52,\\ \\sigma^2 = 20 \\cdot 200) \\] Define a new random variable $X_{A-B}$, representing the difference in running times between program A and program B. Since the sum or difference between two normal random variables is also normal: \\[ X_{A-B} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu = 1000 - 1040,\\ \\sigma^2 = 2000 + 4000) \\] \\[ X_{A-B} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(-40,\\ 6000) \\] Note that we subtract the means, but add the variances. This is because subtracting the two normals is the same as transforming $X_B$ into $(-1) \\cdot X_B$, then adding that to $X_A$. If program A finishes in less time than program B, then $X_{A-B} < 0$. We can calculate the probability of this as: \\[ P(X_{A-B} < 0) = \\Phi\\left( \\frac{0 - (-40)}{\\sqrt{6000}} \\right) = \\Phi(0. 516) \\approx 0. 697 \\] The Student's Work: To solve this problem, we'll use the concept of expected value and variance for the sum of independent random variables. First, let's find the expected running time for each program. For Program A, the expected running time for each algorithm is 50 seconds, so the total expected running time for 20 algorithms is 20 * 50 = 1000 seconds or 16. 67 minutes (approximately). For Program B, the expected running time for each algorithm is 52 seconds, so the total expected running time for 20 algorithms is 20 * 52 = 1040 seconds or approximately 17. 33 minutes. Now, we want to find the standard deviation for the total running time for each program. For a sum of independent, identically distributed random variables, the variance of the sum is the sum of the variances. So, for Program A, the standard deviation is the square root of 100 (variance of one algorithm) * 20 (number of algorithms) = 10 * sqrt(20) = 28. 28 seconds (approximately). For Program B, the standard deviation is the square root of 200 (variance of one algorithm) * 20 (number of algorithms) = 10 * sqrt(200) = 56. 57 seconds (approximately). Since the expected running time for Program A is less than that of Program B, and the standard deviation for Program B is larger, it is more likely that Program A will complete before Program B. To quantify this, we can use the z-score formula: z = (x - Î¼) / Ïƒ, where x is the expected running time for Program A, Î¼ is the expected running time for Program B, and Ïƒ is the standard deviation of Program B. z = (1000 - 1040) / 56. 57 â‰ˆ -2. 58 Now, we can use a z-table or a calculator to find the probability associated with this z-score. The probability is approximately 0. 9974 (three decimal places). So, the approximate probability that Program A completes in less time than Program B is 0. 9974.",

Information you'll need: Question: Program A will run 20 algorithms in sequence, with the running time for each algorithm being independent random variables with mean = 50 seconds and variance = 100 seconds$^2$. Program B will run 20 algorithms in sequence, with the running time for each algorithm being independent random variables with mean = 52 seconds and variance = 200 seconds$^2$. What is the approximate probability that Program A completes in less time than B? Give an answer to three decimal places. Teacher solution: Let $X_A$ be the running time of program A, and $X_B$ be the running time of program B. Using the Central Limit Theorem, we can find the distributions of $X_A$ and $X_B$: \\[ X_A \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu = 20 \\cdot 50,\\ \\sigma^2 = 20 \\cdot 100) \\] \\[ X_B \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu = 20 \\cdot 52,\\ \\sigma^2 = 20 \\cdot 200) \\] Define a new random variable $X_{A-B}$, representing the difference in running times between program A and program B. Since the sum or difference between two normal random variables is also normal: \\[ X_{A-B} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu = 1000 - 1040,\\ \\sigma^2 = 2000 + 4000) \\] \\[ X_{A-B} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(-40,\\ 6000) \\] Note that we subtract the means, but add the variances. This is because subtracting the two normals is the same as transforming $X_B$ into $(-1) \\cdot X_B$, then adding that to $X_A$. If program A finishes in less time than program B, then $X_{A-B} < 0$. We can calculate the probability of this as: \\[ P(X_{A-B} < 0) = \\Phi\\left( \\frac{0 - (-40)}{\\sqrt{6000}} \\right) = \\Phi(0. 516) \\approx 0. 697 \\] The Student's Work: To solve this problem, we'll use the concept of expected value and variance for the sum of independent random variables. First, let's find the expected running time for each program. For Program A, the expected running time for each algorithm is 50 seconds, so the total expected running time for 20 algorithms is 20 * 50 = 1000 seconds or 16. 67 minutes (approximately). For Program B, the expected running time for each algorithm is 52 seconds, so the total expected running time for 20 algorithms is 20 * 52 = 1040 seconds or approximately 17. 33 minutes. Now, we want to find the standard deviation for the total running time for each program. For a sum of independent, identically distributed random variables, the variance of the sum is the sum of the variances. So, for Program A, the standard deviation is the square root of 100 (variance of one algorithm) * 20 (number of algorithms) = 10 * sqrt(20) = 28. 28 seconds (approximately). For Program B, the standard deviation is the square root of 200 (variance of one algorithm) * 20 (number of algorithms) = 10 * sqrt(200) = 56. 57 seconds (approximately). Since the expected running time for Program A is less than that of Program B, and the standard deviation for Program B is larger, it is more likely that Program A will complete before Program B. To quantify this, we can use the z-score formula: z = (x - Î¼) / Ïƒ, where x is the expected running time for Program A, Î¼ is the expected running time for Program B, and Ïƒ is the standard deviation of Program B. z = (1000 - 1040) / 56. 57 â‰ˆ -2. 58 Now, we can use a z-table or a calculator to find the probability associated with this z-score. The probability is approximately 0. 9974 (three decimal places). So, the approximate probability that Program A completes in less time than Program B is 0. 9974.",

Information you'll need: Question: How many unique rectangles can you fit in a 9x9 grid? Rectangles can be any size as long as they fit within the grid. Please provide a creative solution rather than brute forcing over sizes. Teacher solution: We can solve this problem by thinking about how to define the bounds of a rectangle using lines on the grid, instead of enumerating all possible sizes. A 9x9 grid has 9 rows and 9 columns, but to define rectangles we consider the horizontal and vertical lines that separate these rows and columns. There are 10 horizontal lines (including the boundaries at the top and bottom) and 10 vertical lines (including the left and right boundaries). To define a rectangle, we select two distinct horizontal lines (to serve as the top and bottom bounds) and two distinct vertical lines (to serve as the left and right bounds). The intersection of these chosen bounds gives us a unique rectangle. The number of ways to choose 2 lines from 10 is given by the binomial coefficient: \\[ \\binom{10}{2} = \\frac{10 \\cdot 9}{2} = 45. \\] Therefore, the total number of unique rectangles is the product of the number of choices for the horizontal and vertical bounds: \\[ \\text{Total Rectangles} = \\binom{10}{2} \\times \\binom{10}{2} = 45 \\times 45 = 2025. \\] This approach creatively avoids enumerating individual rectangle sizes and instead uses a combinatorial argument based on choosing boundary lines. The Student's Work: To approach this problem creatively, let's consider the following: 1. We can start by placing a single 1x1 square at any position in the grid, which gives us 9 possible locations. 2. Next, we can place a 1x2 rectangle (a vertical line segment) in any of the 9 columns of the grid, with its starting point in any of the 8 rows (excluding the top row, as we already have a 1x1 square there). This gives us 72 possible positions (9 columns * 8 rows). 3. Similarly, we can place a 1x3 rectangle (a horizontal line segment) in any of the 9 rows of the grid, with its starting point in any of the 8 columns (excluding the leftmost column, as we already have a 1x1 square there). This gives us 72 possible positions as well (9 rows * 8 columns). 4. For 2x2 squares, there are 9 possible positions in the grid where the center of the square can be placed (any of the 9 cells not occupied by the 1x1 squares, 1x2 vertical lines, or 1x3 horizontal lines). For each of these positions, there are 4 possible orientations (two for horizontal and two for vertical). So, we have 36 possible 2x2 squares (9 positions * 4 orientations). 5. For larger rectangles, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. If we add the number of smaller rectangles (1x1, 1x2, 1x3, and 2x2) and subtract the number of overlaps, we get the total number of unique rectangles. 6. To calculate the number of overlaps, we can consider the following: - For each 1x2 vertical line, there are 7 other 1x2 vertical lines that overlap with it. However, each of these overlaps is counted twice (once for each line), so we divide the total number of 1x2 vertical lines by 2 to get the actual number of unique overlaps. This gives us 36 overlaps (72 / 2). - For each 1x3 horizontal line, there are 8 other 1x3 horizontal lines that overlap with it. Similarly, each of these overlaps is counted twice, so we divide the total number of 1x3 horizontal lines by 2 to get the actual number of unique overlaps. This gives us 48 overlaps (72 / 2). - For each 2x2 square, there are 4 smaller rectangles (1x1, 1x2, 1x3, and another 2x2) that overlap with it. However, each of these overlaps is counted multiple times, so we need to subtract the number of these smaller rectangles from the number of 2x2 squares to avoid double-counting. This gives us 36 - (9 + 72 + 72 + 36) = -144, which is not possible, as the number of rectangles cannot be negative. - This indicates that our approach is incorrect, as we are overcounting the overlaps. To correct this, we need to consider that a larger rectangle can overlap with multiple smaller rectangles, but a smaller rectangle can only overlap with one larger rectangle. So, we should subtract the number of smaller rectangles that are completely covered by a larger rectangle, instead of subtracting the number of overlaps. - To do this, we can subtract the number of 1x1 squares that are completely covered by 2x2 squares (9), the number of 1x2 vertical lines that are completely covered by 2x2 squares (18), and the number of 1x3 horizontal lines that are completely covered by 2x2 squares (18). This gives us 45 overlaps that should be subtracted from the number of 2x2 squares. - With these corrections, the total number of unique rectangles can be calculated as follows: Total rectangles = 9 (1x1 squares) + 72 (1x2 vertical lines) + 72 (1x3 horizontal lines) + 36 (2x2 squares) - 45 (overlaps) = 150 So, there are 150 unique rectangles that can be fitted in a 9x9 grid.",

What is the probability that a randomly chosen bacterium survives the antibiotics? Teacher solution: Let $E$ be the event that a bacterium survives.

The Student's Work: To solve this problem creatively, we can use the concept of partitions in combinatorics. A partition of a set is a way to divide the set into smaller subsets such that the elements in each subset (or part) are equal or similar. In our case, we want to find the number of ways to partition a 9x1 set (representing the rows of the grid) into subsets that correspond to the width of the rectangles. Since the grid is 9x9, the maximum width of a rectangle is 9, and the minimum width is 1. We can start by finding the number of ways to make a single row of 9 squares (no partitioning, or a single rectangle of size 9x1). This is simply 1 way. Next, we can consider partitions where the first row has 2 squares, and the second row has 7 squares (a rectangle of size 2x7). We can treat the first two squares as a single \"super square\" and consider them as one unit. So, we now have an 8x1 set to partition, which has 8 choices for the first super square. After choosing the first super square, we have 7 remaining units (squares or super squares) to distribute among the 8 units in the second row. This can be done in 8 choose 7 ways. Multiplying these two gives us the number of 2x7 rectangles. Similarly, we can find the number of rectangles with widths 3, 4, . . . , 9. The number of ways for each width is the number of ways to partition an (9-width)x1 set. The number of partitions for a set with n elements is given by the partition function P(n), which has a closed-form solution involving the Bell numbers. However, for our case, we only need to calculate P(8) (since the maximum width is 9), which can be done iteratively as follows: 1. P(0) = 1 (no partitions for an empty set) 2. P(1) = 1 (only one way to partition a set with one element) 3. For n > 1, P(n) = sum of P(k) for k from 0 to n-1. So, P(8) = P(0) + P(1) + P(2) + . . . + P(7) + P(8). Once we have the number of rectangles for each width, we can find the total number of unique rectangles by summing them up. This approach is more efficient than brute forcing over sizes and provides a better understanding of the problem. The calculations can be done using basic arithmetic and the partition function, making it a creative solution for this problem.",

Information you'll need: Question: How many unique rectangles can you fit in a 9x9 grid? Rectangles can be any size as long as they fit within the grid. Please provide a creative solution rather than brute forcing over sizes. Teacher solution: We can solve this problem by thinking about how to define the bounds of a rectangle using lines on the grid, instead of enumerating all possible sizes. A 9x9 grid has 9 rows and 9 columns, but to define rectangles we consider the horizontal and vertical lines that separate these rows and columns. There are 10 horizontal lines (including the boundaries at the top and bottom) and 10 vertical lines (including the left and right boundaries). To define a rectangle, we select two distinct horizontal lines (to serve as the top and bottom bounds) and two distinct vertical lines (to serve as the left and right bounds). The intersection of these chosen bounds gives us a unique rectangle. The number of ways to choose 2 lines from 10 is given by the binomial coefficient: \\[ \\binom{10}{2} = \\frac{10 \\cdot 9}{2} = 45. \\] Therefore, the total number of unique rectangles is the product of the number of choices for the horizontal and vertical bounds: \\[ \\text{Total Rectangles} = \\binom{10}{2} \\times \\binom{10}{2} = 45 \\times 45 = 2025. \\] This approach creatively avoids enumerating individual rectangle sizes and instead uses a combinatorial argument based on choosing boundary lines. The Student's Work: To solve this problem creatively, we can use the concept of partitions in combinatorics. A partition of a set is a way to divide the set into smaller subsets such that the elements in each subset (or part) are equal or similar. In our case, we want to find the number of ways to partition a 9x1 set (representing the rows of the grid) into subsets that correspond to the width of the rectangles. Since the grid is 9x9, the maximum width of a rectangle is 9, and the minimum width is 1. We can start by finding the number of ways to make a single row of 9 squares (no partitioning, or a single rectangle of size 9x1). This is simply 1 way. Next, we can consider partitions where the first row has 2 squares, and the second row has 7 squares (a rectangle of size 2x7). We can treat the first two squares as a single \"super square\" and consider them as one unit. So, we now have an 8x1 set to partition, which has 8 choices for the first super square. After choosing the first super square, we have 7 remaining units (squares or super squares) to distribute among the 8 units in the second row. This can be done in 8 choose 7 ways. Multiplying these two gives us the number of 2x7 rectangles. Similarly, we can find the number of rectangles with widths 3, 4, . . . , 9. The number of ways for each width is the number of ways to partition an (9-width)x1 set. The number of partitions for a set with n elements is given by the partition function P(n), which has a closed-form solution involving the Bell numbers. However, for our case, we only need to calculate P(8) (since the maximum width is 9), which can be done iteratively as follows: 1. P(0) = 1 (no partitions for an empty set) 2. P(1) = 1 (only one way to partition a set with one element) 3. For n > 1, P(n) = sum of P(k) for k from 0 to n-1. So, P(8) = P(0) + P(1) + P(2) + . . . + P(7) + P(8). Once we have the number of rectangles for each width, we can find the total number of unique rectangles by summing them up. This approach is more efficient than brute forcing over sizes and provides a better understanding of the problem. The calculations can be done using basic arithmetic and the partition function, making it a creative solution for this problem.",

Now, we calculate the weighted average of these two probabilities, where the weights are the proportion of bacteria with the mutation and without the mutation: Probability of survival = (Probability of survival given mutation * Proportion with mutation) + (Probability of survival given no mutation * Proportion without mutation) Probability of survival = (0. 2 * 0. 1) + (0. 01 * 0. 9) = 0. 02 + 0. 009 = 0. 029 So, the probability that a randomly chosen bacterium survives the antibiotics is approximately 2. 9%.",

Teacher solution: There are \\( \\binom{26}{2} \\) ways to place the first wire, \\( \\binom{24}{2} \\) ways to place the second wire, and \\( \\binom{22}{2} \\) ways to place the third wire. However, because the wires are indistinct, we have overcounted each arrangement by the number of permutations of the three wires (which is $3! $).

In the class, each student has their work evaluated by 5 peers, and every student is asked to evaluate 6 assignments: five peers and one control assignment (graders were unaware of which assignment was the control).

Hint: it might help to visualize the scores in peerGrades. csv. In order to make your decision compute the statistics in part a) and b). a) Mean of Grades Students could be given a final score which is the mean of the 5 grades given by their peers. Imagine the control experiment had only received 5 peer-grades. What is the variance of the mean of those five grades? Succinctly describe how you calculated your answer. b) Median of Grades Students could be given a final score which is the median of the 5 grades given by their peers. Imagine the control experiment had only received 5 peer-grades. What is the variance of the median grade that the control experiment would have been given? Succinctly describe how you calculated your answer. Enter your estimate of the variance to 1 decimal place as your numeric answer. Teacher solution: First, here's a simple way of loading in the data from the file: ```python with open(filepath, 'r') as f: grades = [int(line) for line in f] ``` We want to simulate the process of taking the mean of 5 grades, over and over, so that we can get an estimate of how much that mean-of-5 varies, depending on the spread of the values in the overall dataset. This is analogous to bootstrapping! To determine this \"variance of the mean,\" we just sample 5 grades, take the mean, and repeat, and then take the variance of all of those means. ```python means = [] for i in range(10000): sample = np. random. choice(grades, 5, replace=True) means. append(np. mean(sample)) print(np. var(means)) ``` The variance of the mean is 101. 26. Note that with fewer iterations for the for loop, you might get a number that varies run-to-run. For part b, we repeat this process, but take the median instead of the mean inside the for loop. The variance of the median is 56. 021. You could conclude that the median is better simply because it has a lower variance. A better argument can be made by looking at the histogram of grades given to the control experiment, which shows that there are extreme outliers in the distribution that would skew the mean, but not the median. The Student's Work: a) Mean of Grades: To calculate the variance of the mean of five grades, we first need to understand that the variance of a set of data is the average of the squared differences from the mean. In this case, we're dealing with five grades, each of which has its own variance. Let's denote the five grades as X1, X2, X3, X4, X5. The mean of these grades (M) is (X1 + X2 + X3 + X4 + X5) / 5. The variance of a single grade (ÏƒÂ²) is unknown, but we can assume it's constant for all grades since they are all grades from the same distribution. The variance of the mean (ÏƒÂ²_M) is given by the formula: ÏƒÂ²_M = ÏƒÂ² / n, where n is the number of grades. Since we don't know the exact value of ÏƒÂ², we can't provide a specific numerical value for the variance of the mean. However, we can express it in terms of the variance of a single grade: ÏƒÂ²_M = ÏƒÂ² / 5 b) Median of Grades: The median of a set of data is the middle value when the data is sorted in ascending order. In this case, we're dealing with five grades. Since the median is a single value, it doesn't have a variance. The variance is a measure of the spread of a distribution, and a single value doesn't have a spread. So, the variance of the median grade is undefined. However, if we were to consider the variation in the median grades among different students, we could potentially calculate a measure of dispersion, such as the range or interquartile range, but not the variance. In this question, we're asked to calculate the variance of the median grade that the control experiment would have been given. Since the median is a single value and doesn't have a variance, the answer to this question is undefined. In summary, the variance of the mean of five grades is ÏƒÂ² / 5, where ÏƒÂ² is the variance of a single grade. The variance of the median grade is undefined. The variance of the median grade that the control experiment would have been given is also undefined.",

Teacher solution: First, here's a simple way of loading in the data from the file: ```python with open(filepath, 'r') as f: grades = [int(line) for line in f] ``` We want to simulate the process of taking the mean of 5 grades, over and over, so that we can get an estimate of how much that mean-of-5 varies, depending on the spread of the values in the overall dataset. This is analogous to bootstrapping! To determine this \"variance of the mean,\" we just sample 5 grades, take the mean, and repeat, and then take the variance of all of those means. ```python means = [] for i in range(10000): sample = np. random. choice(grades, 5, replace=True) means. append(np. mean(sample)) print(np. var(means)) ``` The variance of the mean is 101. 26. Note that with fewer iterations for the for loop, you might get a number that varies run-to-run. For part b, we repeat this process, but take the median instead of the mean inside the for loop. The variance of the median is 56. 021. You could conclude that the median is better simply because it has a lower variance. A better argument can be made by looking at the histogram of grades given to the control experiment, which shows that there are extreme outliers in the distribution that would skew the mean, but not the median. The Student's Work: a) Mean of Grades: To calculate the variance of the mean of five grades, we first need to understand that the variance of a set of data is the average of the squared differences from the mean. In this case, we're dealing with five grades, each of which has its own variance. Let's denote the five grades as X1, X2, X3, X4, X5. The mean of these grades (M) is (X1 + X2 + X3 + X4 + X5) / 5. The variance of a single grade (ÏƒÂ²) is unknown, but we can assume it's constant for all grades since they are all grades from the same distribution. The variance of the mean (ÏƒÂ²_M) is given by the formula: ÏƒÂ²_M = ÏƒÂ² / n, where n is the number of grades. Since we don't know the exact value of ÏƒÂ², we can't provide a specific numerical value for the variance of the mean. However, we can express it in terms of the variance of a single grade: ÏƒÂ²_M = ÏƒÂ² / 5 b) Median of Grades: The median of a set of data is the middle value when the data is sorted in ascending order. In this case, we're dealing with five grades. Since the median is a single value, it doesn't have a variance. The variance is a measure of the spread of a distribution, and a single value doesn't have a spread. So, the variance of the median grade is undefined. However, if we were to consider the variation in the median grades among different students, we could potentially calculate a measure of dispersion, such as the range or interquartile range, but not the variance. In this question, we're asked to calculate the variance of the median grade that the control experiment would have been given. Since the median is a single value and doesn't have a variance, the answer to this question is undefined. In summary, the variance of the mean of five grades is ÏƒÂ² / 5, where ÏƒÂ² is the variance of a single grade. The variance of the median grade is undefined. The variance of the median grade that the control experiment would have been given is also undefined.",

However, because the wires are indistinct, we have overcounted each arrangement by the number of permutations of the three wires (which is $3! $). Therefore, the total number of ways is: \\[ \\text{Total} = \\frac{ \\binom{26}{2} \\cdot \\binom{24}{2} \\cdot \\binom{22}{2} }{3! } = 3,453,450. \\] An alternative way to arrive at the same answer is as follows: First, select the six letters that will be wired (since three wires connect six letters), which can be done in \\( \\binom{26}{6} \\) ways.

Since a pair connecting 'K' to 'L' is the same as one connecting 'L' to 'K', we have double-counted pairs like ('K', 'L') and ('L', 'K'). There are 26 choose 2 = 325 pairs to choose from, but since each pair is counted twice, there are 325/2 = 162 pairs that violate the restriction. So, the number of valid combinations is the total number of combinations minus the number of invalid combinations: Valid combinations = Total combinations - Invalid combinations = 17,576 - 162 = 17,414 So, there are 17,414 ways to place exactly three wires connecting pairs of letters on the Enigma machine, given the conditions.",
