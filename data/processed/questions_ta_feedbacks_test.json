        "question_text": "The Enigma machine used by the Nazis in WW2 had a plug board where wires could swap the electrical signal for letters. A wire cannot connect a letter to itself, and the wires are indistinct (e.g., a wire connecting 'K' to 'L' is the same as one connecting 'L' to 'K'). How many ways are there to place exactly three wires connecting pairs of letters, given that there are 26 letters in total?",
        "ta_solution": "There are \\( \\binom{26}{2} \\) ways to place the first wire, \\( \\binom{24}{2} \\) ways to place the second wire, and \\( \\binom{22}{2} \\) ways to place the third wire. However, because the wires are indistinct, we have overcounted each arrangement by the number of permutations of the three wires (which is $3!$). Therefore, the total number of ways is: \\[ \\text{Total} = \\frac{ \\binom{26}{2} \\cdot \\binom{24}{2} \\cdot \\binom{22}{2} }{3!} = 3,453,450. \\] An alternative way to arrive at the same answer is as follows: First, select the six letters that will be wired (since three wires connect six letters), which can be done in \\( \\binom{26}{6} \\) ways. Then, permute these six letters in $6!$ ways and group them into pairs. But this overcounts in two ways: (1) by a factor of $3!$ for the ordering of the three pairs, and (2) by a factor of $2^3$ because the ordering within each pair does not matter. Therefore, the total is also: \\[ \\text{Total} = \\binom{26}{6} \\cdot \\frac{6!}{3! \\cdot 2^3} = 3,453,450. \\] Both methods confirm the same result.",
        "stu_solution": "To solve this problem, we will use the concept of combinations since the order of the pairs does not matter. We have 26 letters in the alphabet, and we want to choose 3 pairs out of 26 letters.\n\nFirst, we will choose the first letter of each pair. We have 26 choices for the first letter, 25 choices for the second letter (since we cannot use the same letter), and 24 choices for the third letter (we cannot use the first two letters and cannot use the same letter as the second pair).\n\nSo, the number of choices for the first, second, and third letters is 26C1 * 25C1 * 24C1. However, since a pair can be represented in two ways (e.g., K-L and L-K), we need to divide this by 2 to avoid double-counting.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to place exactly three wires connecting pairs of letters is:\n\n(26C1 * 25C1 * 24C1) / 2\n\nThis is a combinatorial problem, and the expression above can be calculated using the formula for combinations or with a calculator.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that this calculation assumes that no two wires connect the same pair of letters. If we allow multiple wires connecting the same pair of letters (e.g., K-L, L-K, and L-K), the calculation would be different. In that case, we would be counting triples of wires, not pairs, and the calculation would require a different approach.",

Succinctly describe how you calculated your answer. Enter your estimate of the variance to 1 decimal place as your numeric answer.",
        "ta_solution": "First, here's a simple way of loading in the data from the file:\n\n```python\nwith open(filepath, 'r') as f:\n    grades = [int(line) for line in f]\n```\n\nWe want to simulate the process of taking the mean of 5 grades, over and over, so that we can get an estimate of how much that mean-of-5 varies, depending on the spread of the values in the overall dataset. This is analogous to bootstrapping! To determine this \"variance of the mean,\" we just sample 5 grades, take the mean, and repeat, and then take the variance of all of those means.\n\n```python\nmeans = []\nfor i in range(10000):\n    sample = np.random.choice(grades, 5, replace=True)\n    means.append(np.mean(sample))\n\nprint(np.var(means))\n```\n\nThe variance of the mean is 101.26. Note that with fewer iterations for the for loop, you might get a number that varies run-to-run.\n\nFor part b, we repeat this process, but take the median instead of the mean inside the for loop. The variance of the median is 56.021.\n\nYou could conclude that the median is better simply because it has a lower variance. A better argument can be made by looking at the histogram of grades given to the control experiment, which shows that there are extreme outliers in the distribution that would skew the mean, but not the median.",
        "stu_solution": "a) Mean of Grades:\n\nTo calculate the variance of the mean of five grades, we first need to understand that the variance of the mean is equal to the variance of the data divided by the number of data points.\n\nIn this case, we are dealing with five grades for each student, and we assume that these grades are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables. If the variance of each grade (σ²) is known, the variance of the mean (σ²_mean) can be calculated as follows:\n\nσ²_mean = σ² / n\n\nwhere n is the number of grades (in this case, 5).\n\nHowever, since we don't know the variance of the grades, we cannot calculate the exact variance of the mean. Instead, we can use the Bessel's correction to estimate the variance of a sample mean, which is a more accurate estimation when dealing with small sample sizes. The formula for the variance of the sample mean is:\n\nσ²_mean = (σ² * (n-1)) / n\n\nWe cannot calculate the exact value since we don't have the variance of the grades. But we can estimate the value using a simulation. For example, you could generate many sets of 5 random grades with the same mean and variance as your data, calculate the mean of each set, and then calculate the sample mean of those means to estimate the variance of the mean.\n\nb) Median of Grades:\n\nThe median of the five grades is the middle value when the grades are sorted in ascending order. Since we are dealing with 5 grades, the median is the average of the 3rd and 4th grades.\n\nTo find the variance of the median, we need to understand that the median is a rank-based measure, not a location-based measure like the mean. As a result, the median is not affected by outliers and is less sensitive to extreme values. However, the median itself is a constant (the average of the 3rd and 4th grades) for each student, so its variance is 0.\n\nIn this case, the variance of the median grade is 0, as the median is a constant value for each student, and there is no randomness associated with it.\n\nIn numeric terms, the variance of the median grade is 0.0.",

The intersection of these chosen bounds gives us a unique rectangle. The number of ways to choose 2 lines from 10 is given by the binomial coefficient: \\[ \\binom{10}{2} = \\frac{10 \\cdot 9}{2} = 45. \\] Therefore, the total number of unique rectangles is the product of the number of choices for the horizontal and vertical bounds: \\[ \\text{Total Rectangles} = \\binom{10}{2} \\times \\binom{10}{2} = 45 \\times 45 = 2025. \\] This approach creatively avoids enumerating individual rectangle sizes and instead uses a combinatorial argument based on choosing boundary lines.",
        "stu_solution": "To solve this problem creatively, let's consider the following approach:\n\n1. We can treat the 10x8 grid as a 10x8 array of cells, where each cell can be occupied or empty.\n\n2. A rectangle is defined by two points, one in the top-left corner and one in the bottom-right corner. For a rectangle to fit within the grid, the bottom-right corner's x-coordinate must be less than or equal to 10, and the bottom-right corner's y-coordinate must be less than or equal to 8.\n\n3. Now, for a given row (y-coordinate), we can find the number of possible rectangles by counting the number of ways to choose two columns (x-coordinates) out of 10. This is a combination problem, which can be calculated using the formula C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of items (columns in this case) and k is the number of items to choose (the two columns defining the rectangle's width). So, for each row, we have C(10, 2) = 45 possible rectangles.\n\n4. However, we've double-counted rectangles that span multiple rows, as we've counted each one for every row it intersects. To correct for this, we need to subtract the number of rectangles that span more than one row.\n\n5. For a rectangle to span more than one row, its height (the difference between the y-coordinates of the top-left and bottom-right corners) must be greater than 1. The maximum height for a rectangle within the grid is 8, so we can find the number of rectangles that span more than one row by summing up C(8, 2) (for rectangles spanning exactly two rows) to C(8, 8) (for rectangles spanning all 8 rows).\n\n6. Finally, we subtract the number of rectangles that span more than one row from the total number of rectangles in each row to get the number of unique rectangles that fit within the grid:\n\n   Total rectangles in each row = C(10, 2) = 45\n   Rectangles spanning more than one row = Sum(C(8, k)) for k = 2 to 8\n\n   So, the number of unique rectangles that fit within the 10x8 grid is:\n\n   45 * (1 - Sum(C(8, k)) for k = 2 to 8)\n\nThis solution provides an efficient way to calculate the number of unique rectangles that can fit within the grid, without needing to brute force over sizes.",

Since the running time for each algorithm is an independent random variable with mean 52 seconds and variance 200 seconds², the total running time T for Program B follows a chi-squared distribution with 18 degrees of freedom (since the sum of squares of 18 independent standard normal variables follows a chi-squared distribution). The expected value (mean) of a chi-squared distribution with n degrees of freedom is n, and the variance is 2*n. So, the mean of T is 18*52 = 936 seconds, and the variance is 2*18 = 36.\n\n2. To find the approximate probability that Program A completes in less time than B, we need to compare the expected running time of Program A with the mean running time of Program B.

To find the probability that Program A completes in less time than B, we can use the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the normal distribution.

Now we have another at least event. At least one person being busy means exactly one person is busy, or both of them are busy. You could use inclusion-exclusion here (probability of or without mutual exclusion, where you need to subtract the intersection), but we could also just take the complement again:= 1 - P(a block is busy for at least one person)^8= 1 - (1 - P(block is free for both people))^8= 1 - (1 - P(person 1 free ∩ person 2 free))^8= 1 - (1 - P(person is free for one block)^2)^8= 1 - (1 - (1 - 0.7)^2)^8.
