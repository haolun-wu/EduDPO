Question: Two people are trying to schedule a meeting. What is the probability that there is at least one block of time when they are both free on a given day? Provide an answer to 3 decimal places.",
        "ta_solution": "Solving this problem requires us to recognize how helpful it is to take the complement a few times. First, since we are looking for the probability that at least one block of time is free for both people, we can simplify our calculations by taking the complement of at least one and instead finding one minus the probability that all blocks of time are busy for at least one of the two people.P(1+ time free for both) = 1 - P(all times busy)= 1 - P(block 1 busy ∩ block 2 busy ∩ ... ∩ block 8 busy)= 1 - P(a block is busy for at least one person)^8 We break down the probability of and above by noting that independence between blocks lets us multiply together the probabilities for the individual blocks being busy. Now we have another at least event. At least one person being busy means exactly one person is busy, or both of them are busy. You could use inclusion-exclusion here (probability of or without mutual exclusion, where you need to subtract the intersection), but we could also just take the complement again:= 1 - P(a block is busy for at least one person)^8= 1 - (1 - P(block is free for both people))^8= 1 - (1 - P(person 1 free ∩ person 2 free))^8= 1 - (1 - P(person is free for one block)^2)^8= 1 - (1 - (1 - 0.7)^2)^8. Above, we used independence between people to break down a probability of and into the product of the probability that one person is free for a particular block, and finally, we plugged in the complement of the probability that a person is busy for one block."

This is analogous to bootstrapping! To determine this \"variance of the mean,\" we just sample 5 grades, take the mean, and repeat, and then take the variance of all of those means.\n\n```python\nmeans = []\nfor i in range(10000):\n    sample = np.random.choice(grades, 5, replace=True)\n    means.append(np.mean(sample))\n\nprint(np.var(means))\n```\n\nThe variance of the mean is 101.26.

The variance of the median is 56.021.\n\nYou could conclude that the median is better simply because it has a lower variance. A better argument can be made by looking at the histogram of grades given to the control experiment, which shows that there are extreme outliers in the distribution that would skew the mean, but not the median."

There are 10 horizontal lines (including the boundaries at the top and bottom) and 10 vertical lines (including the left and right boundaries).
