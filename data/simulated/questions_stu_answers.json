        "stu_solution": "a) Mean of Grades\nTo calculate the variance of the mean of 5 grades, we first need to calculate the variance of a single grade. Let's assume that the grades are normally distributed with a mean of μ and a standard deviation of σ. The variance of a single grade is σ^2.\n\nNow, let's consider the mean of 5 grades. The mean of 5 grades is the sum of the 5 grades divided by 5. The variance of the mean is given by the formula:\n\nVar(mean) = Var(sum) / n^2\n\nwhere Var(sum) is the variance of the sum of 5 grades and n is the number of grades (5 in this case).\n\nThe variance of the sum of 5 grades can be calculated as the sum of the variances of the individual grades plus 10 times the covariance between any two grades (since there are 5 pairs of grades). However, since we are dealing with peer grades, we can assume that the grades are independent, so the covariance between any two grades is 0.\n\nSo, the variance of the mean of 5 grades is:\n\nVar(mean) = (σ^2 + 10 * 0) / 5^2 = σ^2 / 25\n\nb) Median of Grades\nTo calculate the variance of the median grade, we need to understand that the median is a rank-based measure, and its distribution is not normally distributed. Therefore, it does not have a variance in the traditional sense. Instead, we can use a measure called the \"interquartile range\" (IQR) to get an idea of the spread of the data around the median.\n\nThe IQR is the difference between the 75th percentile (Q3) and the 25th percentile (Q1). In a normally distributed dataset, the IQR is approximately 1.35 times the standard deviation.\n\nSince we don't have the actual data, we can't calculate the IQR directly. However, we can simulate the distribution of the median grade by randomly sampling 5 grades from a normal distribution with a mean of μ and a standard deviation of σ, and then calculating the median of those 5 grades. We can repeat this process many times to get an estimate of the IQR.\n\nFor simplicity, let's assume that μ = 70 and σ = 10 (these are just arbitrary values for the sake of the example). We can simulate the distribution of the median grade as follows:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport scipy.stats as stats\n\n# Generate 10000 samples of 5 grades each\nsamples = np.random.normal(70, 10, size=(10000, 5))\n\n# Calculate the median of each sample\nmedians = np.median(samples, axis=1)\n\n# Calculate the IQR\nQ1 = np.percentile(medians, 25)\nQ3 = np.percentile(medians, 75)\nIQR = Q3 - Q1\n\n# Estimate the variance of the median as approximately (IQR / 1.35)^2\nvariance_of_median = (IQR / 1.35) ** 2\n\n# Print the estimated variance of the median\nprint(f\"The estimated variance of the median is {variance_of_median:.1f}\")\n```\n\nThis script generates 10,000 samples of 5 grades each, calculates the median of each sample, and then calculates the IQR. The estimated variance of the median is then approximately (IQR / 1.35)^2.\n\nIn this example, the estimated variance of the median is approximately 100.0. However, this is just an estimate based on the assumption that the grades are normally distributed with a mean of 70 and a standard deviation of 10. The actual variance of the median in the real data might be different.",

        "stu_solution": "a) Mean of Grades\nThe variance of the mean of a sample is given by the formula:\n\nVar(mean) = Var(X) / n\n\nwhere X is the population and n is the sample size. In this case, we are given a sample of 5 grades for the control assignment, and we are assuming that the population of grades for the control assignment follows a normal distribution (as is common in peer assessment).\n\nTo find the variance of the population, we can use the sample variance as an estimate. The sample variance is given by:\n\ns^2 = (1/(n-1)) * Σ(xi - mean)^2\n\nwhere xi is each of the 5 grades, mean is the mean of the 5 grades, and Σ is the sum of the squared differences from the mean.\n\nUsing the given data, we can calculate the sample variance as follows:\n\ns^2 = (1/4) * [(grade1 - mean)^2 + (grade2 - mean)^2 + (grade3 - mean)^2 + (grade4 - mean)^2 + (grade5 - mean)^2]\n\nwhere mean is the mean of the 5 grades.\n\nThe variance of the mean is then:\n\nVar(mean) = s^2 / n = s^2 / 5\n\nb) Median of Grades\nThe median of a sample is not affected by outliers, so the variance of the median is 0 if the sample size is odd, and is the variance of the two middle values if the sample size is even. In this case, we are given a sample of 5 grades for the control assignment, and we are assuming that the population of grades for the control assignment follows a normal distribution.\n\nSince the sample size is odd, the variance of the median is 0. However, it's important to note that this is only an approximation, as the median is not a linear statistic and its distribution is not necessarily normal.\n\nIn practice, it's more common to use the interquartile range (IQR) as a measure of spread for a median-based score, rather than the variance. The IQR is the difference between the 75th percentile and the 25th percentile of the data. In this case, the IQR would be the difference between the 4th and 6th grades, assuming the grades are sorted in ascending order.\n\nTo estimate the IQR, we can use the sample data as follows:\n\nIQR = grade4 - grade6\n\nAgain, it's important to note that this is only an approximation, as the sample size is small and the data may not follow a normal distribution.\n\nIn summary, the variance of the mean of the 5 grades is an estimate of the variance of the population mean, and is given by:\n\nVar(mean) = s^2 / 5\n\nwhere s^2 is the sample variance calculated as described above. The variance of the median is 0, but the IQR can be used as a measure of spread for a median-based score.",

        "stu_solution": "To answer this question, let's first compute the mean and median of the 5 peer grades for each student in the dataset.\n\na) Compute the mean and median of 5 peer grades:\n\nTo compute the mean, we sum the 5 peer grades and divide by 5. To compute the median, we first sort the 5 peer grades in ascending order, and then find the middle value (if the number of grades is even, we take the average of the two middle values).\n\nHere's a Python code snippet to compute the mean and median for each student in the dataset:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Load the data\ndata = pd.read_csv('peerGrades.csv', header=None)\n\n# Reshape the data so that each row represents a student\ndata = data.values.reshape(-1, 6)\n\n# Compute the mean and median for each student\ndata[:, 5] = data[:, 0:5].mean(axis=1)\ndata[:, 6] = np.median(data[:, 0:5])\n\n# Save the results to a new CSV file\ndata.to_csv('peerGrades_mean_median.csv', index=False, header=['ID', 'Mean', 'Median'])\n```\n\nAfter running this code, you will have a new CSV file named `peerGrades_mean_median.csv` containing the ID, mean, and median scores for each student.\n\nNow, let's compare the mean and median scores to decide which one to use:\n\n1. The mean is sensitive to outliers, meaning that a single very high or very low score can significantly affect the mean. In this case, since students are evaluating each other's work, it's possible that some students might be more lenient or strict than others, leading to outliers in the peer grades.\n\n2. The median is less sensitive to outliers, as it only considers the middle value(s) in the sorted list of scores. This makes the median a more robust measure of central tendency.\n\nBased on these considerations, it might be more appropriate to use the median of 5 peer grades to assign scores in the online version of Stanford's HCI class.

In this case, n = 5 (since each student is given 5 peer-grades). However, we don't have the original grades, only the mean grades. To find the variance of the original grades, we can use the formula for the variance of a sample mean again:\n\nσ^2 = (σ^2_bar * (n-1)) / n\n\nwhere σ^2_bar is the variance of the mean grades. Since we don't have the original grades, we can't calculate the variance of the mean grades directly. But we can make an assumption that the grades are normally distributed (or approximately so) and use the fact that the mean of the mean grades is the mean of the original grades, and the variance of the mean grades is the variance of the original grades divided by the number of grades.
