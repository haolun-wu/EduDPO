The CLT states that the sum of a large number of independent, identically distributed random variables will have an approximately normal distribution.\n\nFirst, let's find the standard deviation of the total running time for Program A. If X is the running time for each algorithm, then the total running time T for Program A is the sum of 20 independent X's. The variance of T is 20 * 200 = 4000.

Now we have another at least event. At least one person being busy means exactly one person is busy, or both of them are busy. You could use inclusion-exclusion here (probability of or without mutual exclusion, where you need to subtract the intersection), but we could also just take the complement again:= 1 - P(a block is busy for at least one person)^8= 1 - (1 - P(block is free for both people))^8= 1 - (1 - P(person 1 free ∩ person 2 free))^8= 1 - (1 - P(person is free for one block)^2)^8= 1 - (1 - (1 - 0.7)^2)^8.

All 10,000 students evaluated the same control assignment, and the scores they gave are in the file peerGrades.csv.\n\nWould you use the mean or the median of 5 peer grades to assign scores in the online version of Stanford's HCI class?

This is analogous to bootstrapping! To determine this \"variance of the mean,\" we just sample 5 grades, take the mean, and repeat, and then take the variance of all of those means.\n\n```python\nmeans = []\nfor i in range(10000):\n    sample = np.random.choice(grades, 5, replace=True)\n    means.append(np.mean(sample))\n\nprint(np.var(means))\n```\n\nThe variance of the mean is 101.26.

The variance of the median is 56.021.\n\nYou could conclude that the median is better simply because it has a lower variance. A better argument can be made by looking at the histogram of grades given to the control experiment, which shows that there are extreme outliers in the distribution that would skew the mean, but not the median.",
        "stu_solution": "a) Mean of Grades:\nTo calculate the variance of the mean of five grades, we first need to find the variance of a single grade and then apply the formula for the variance of the mean.\n\n1. Variance of a single grade:\n   Since we don't have the actual data, let's assume that the grades are normally distributed with a mean of μ and a standard deviation of σ. The variance of a single grade is σ² (the square of the standard deviation).\n\n2. Variance of the mean:\n   The variance of the mean is given by the formula σ²/n, where n is the number of grades being averaged. In this case, n = 5.\n\nSo, the variance of the mean of five grades would be σ²/5.\n\nb) Median of Grades:\nThe median of a set of data is not a random variable, meaning its value does not change from sample to sample. Therefore, the variance of the median does not apply in this case because the median is a measure of central tendency, not a measure of dispersion.\n\nHowever, if we were to approximate the variance of the median for the sake of comparison, we could use the formula for the variance of the sample mean (σ²/n) and then take the limit as n approaches infinity (since the median is the 50th percentile of a large dataset). This would give us 0, but since we're only considering a sample of 5 grades, the variance of the median is not applicable in this context.\n\nIn summary, for this problem, it would be more appropriate to use the mean of the 5 peer grades to assign scores in the online version of Stanford's HCI class. The variance of the mean of five grades is σ²/5, where σ² is the variance of a single grade. The variance of the median is not applicable in this case.\n\nFor part a), the variance of the mean of five grades is not provided as we don't have the actual data or the standard deviation of a single grade.",

The correct approach is to simulate the process of drawing medians from multiple samples and then calculate the variance of these simulated medians, as shown in the suggested solution.\n\nOverall, the student's solution is partially correct but misses the key point about estimating the variance of the median using bootstrapping. The student should revise the explanation for part b) to correctly address the estimation of the variance of the median.",
        "llama_feedback": "The student's solution is mostly correct. \n\nHowever, in part b), the student's explanation of the variance of the median is not accurate.

This is not a valid reason, as the variance of the median can be calculated for any sample size. \n\nThe student's conclusion that the variance of the median is 0 is also incorrect, as it should be σ²/5, just like the variance of the mean. \n\nThe student's final answer is also incorrect, as they claim that the variance of the mean of five grades is not provided, but the problem asks for the variance of the mean to be computed, not the variance of the population.\n\nIn general, the student's solution is good, but it could be improved by providing the correct formula for the variance of the median and calculating the correct value for the variance of the median in part b).",
        "ta_feedback": "The student's solution is mostly correct, but there are a few inaccuracies and missing details that need to be addressed. \n\nIn part a), the student correctly identifies the formula for the variance of the mean, which is σ²/n, where σ² is the variance of a single grade and n is the number of grades being averaged. However, the student does not provide the actual value for the variance of a single grade, which is necessary to compute the variance of the mean. The student also does not mention the simulation approach used in the suggested solution to estimate the variance of the mean.\n\nIn part b), the student incorrectly states that the variance of the median is not applicable because the median is not a random variable. While it is true that the median is a measure of central tendency, it can still have variability, which can be estimated using bootstrapping. The student also incorrectly claims that the variance of the median is 0, which is not true. The variance of the median can be calculated using the formula σ²/n, just like the variance of the mean. The student also does not provide the actual value for the variance of the median, which is necessary to complete the solution.\n\nOverall, the student's solution is on the right track, but it needs to be revised to include the correct formulas and calculations for the variance of the mean and the variance of the median. The student should also provide the actual values for the variances, which can be obtained using the simulation approach or other methods.  Corrected Student Solution:\na) Mean of Grades:\nTo calculate the variance of the mean of five grades, we first need to find the variance of a single grade. Let's assume that the grades are normally distributed with a mean of μ and a standard deviation of σ. The variance of a single grade is σ².\n\nThe variance of the mean is given by the formula σ²/n, where n is the number of grades being averaged. In this case, n = 5.\n\nSo, the variance of the mean of five grades would be σ²/5.\n\nb) Median of Grades:\nThe median of a set of data is not a random variable, meaning its value does not change from sample to sample. However, we can still estimate its variability using bootstrapping. \n\nTo estimate the variance of the median, we can simulate the process of drawing medians from multiple samples and then calculate the variance of these simulated medians. \n\nLet's assume that we have a sample of 5 grades: [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. The median of this sample is 6. We can then draw multiple samples of 5 grades from the original dataset and calculate the median for each sample. For example, we might draw the following samples: [4, 5, 6, 7, 8], [5, 6, 7, 8, 9], [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. The medians of these samples are 6, 7, and 8, respectively. We can then calculate the variance of these medians, which would give us an estimate of the variance of the median.\n\nIn this case, the variance of the medians is (6-7.33)² + (7-7.33)² + (8-7.33)² = 1.33. This is an estimate of the variance of the median, which we can use to compare the mean and median as measures of central tendency.\n\nIn summary, the variance of the mean of five grades is σ²/5, and the variance of the median can be estimated using bootstrapping. The mean and median are both measures of central tendency, but the mean is more sensitive to extreme values, while the median is more robust to outliers. Depending on the distribution of the grades, the mean or the median may be a better measure of central tendency."

        "question_text": "Stanford's HCI class runs a massive online class that was taken by ten thousand students. The class used peer assessment to evaluate student work. In the class, each student has their work evaluated by 5 peers, and every student is asked to evaluate 6 assignments: five peers and one control assignment (graders were unaware of which assignment was the control). All 10,000 students evaluated the same control assignment, and the scores they gave are in the file peerGrades.csv.\n\nWould you use the mean or the median of 5 peer grades to assign scores in the online version of Stanford's HCI class? Explain why. You may use simulations to solve any part of this question. Hint: it might help to visualize the scores in peerGrades.csv. In order to make your decision compute the statistics in part a) and b).\n\na) Mean of Grades\nStudents could be given a final score which is the mean of the 5 grades given by their peers. Imagine the control experiment had only received 5 peer-grades. What is the variance of the mean of those five grades? Succinctly describe how you calculated your answer.\n\nb) Median of Grades\nStudents could be given a final score which is the median of the 5 grades given by their peers.

        "ta_solution": "First, here's a simple way of loading in the data from the file:\n\n```python\nwith open(filepath, 'r') as f:\n    grades = [int(line) for line in f]\n```\n\nWe want to simulate the process of taking the mean of 5 grades, over and over, so that we can get an estimate of how much that mean-of-5 varies, depending on the spread of the values in the overall dataset. This is analogous to bootstrapping! To determine this \"variance of the mean,\" we just sample 5 grades, take the mean, and repeat, and then take the variance of all of those means.\n\n```python\nmeans = []\nfor i in range(10000):\n    sample = np.random.choice(grades, 5, replace=True)\n    means.append(np.mean(sample))\n\nprint(np.var(means))\n```\n\nThe variance of the mean is 101.26. Note that with fewer iterations for the for loop, you might get a number that varies run-to-run.\n\nFor part b, we repeat this process, but take the median instead of the mean inside the for loop. The variance of the median is 56.021.\n\nYou could conclude that the median is better simply because it has a lower variance. A better argument can be made by looking at the histogram of grades given to the control experiment, which shows that there are extreme outliers in the distribution that would skew the mean, but not the median.",
        "stu_solution": "To answer this question, let's first compute the mean and median of the peer grades for each student's control assignment, and then compare the two methods to determine which one might be more suitable for assigning scores in the online version of Stanford's HCI class.\n\na) Computing the mean and median of 5 peer grades:\n\nTo compute the mean, we add up all the grades for each student and divide by 5 (the number of peer grades). To compute the median, we sort the grades in ascending order, find the middle value (if there is an even number of grades, we take the average of the two middle values), and use that as the median.\n\nUsing a programming language like Python, we can read the data from the `peerGrades.csv` file, compute the mean and median for each student, and store the results in lists.\n\n```python\nimport csv\nimport numpy as np\n\nmean_scores = []\nmedian_scores = []\n\nwith open('peerGrades.csv', 'r') as file:\n    reader = csv.reader(file)\n    next(reader)  # Skip the header row\n    for row in reader:\n        grades = list(map(float, row))\n        mean_score = np.mean(grades)\n        median_score = np.median(grades)\n        mean_scores.append(mean_score)\n        median_scores.append(median_score)\n```\n\nb) Comparing mean and median:\n\nNow that we have the mean and median scores for each student, we can compare the two methods.\n\nThe mean is sensitive to outliers, meaning that a single very high or very low grade can significantly affect the overall score. On the other hand, the median is less affected by outliers since it is based on the middle value(s) of the data.\n\nIn the context of peer grading, it is possible that some students may be more lenient or strict than others, leading to outliers in the grades. Using the median as the score might be more appropriate in this case since it is less sensitive to outliers.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that using the median might not always be the best choice, as it discards information about the distribution of grades. If the grades are normally distributed, the mean might be a better choice. To make a definitive decision, it would be helpful to have more information about the distribution of grades and the nature of the peer grading system.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the given scenario, using the median of 5 peer grades might be a more appropriate method for assigning scores in the online version of Stanford's HCI class, as it is less sensitive to outliers. However, further analysis might be needed to confirm this decision.",
