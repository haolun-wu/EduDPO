The Law of Total Probability (LOTP) is significant in solving this problem because it allows us to calculate the overall probability of an event by considering all possible ways that event can occur. In this case, the event is the survival of a bacterium after taking antibiotics, and there are two possible ways this can happen: either the bacterium has the mutation (event A) or it does not have the mutation (event ~A). By using the LOTP, we can calculate the overall probability of survival by considering the probability of survival given each of these two scenarios and their respective probabilities. This approach simplifies the problem and provides a clear and concise way to find the desired probability. Without the LOTP, we would need to consider each bacterium individually, which would be impractical given the large population size. The LOTP allows us to efficiently calculate the overall probability by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable parts.I agree with your explanation of the significance of the Law of Total Probability (LOTP) in solving this problem.
