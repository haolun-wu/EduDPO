First, let's calculate the expected running time for each program. The expected value (mean) of a normally distributed random variable is equal to the sum of the means of its independent components. So, for Program A, the expected running time is 20 * 50 = 1000 seconds (approximately 166.67 minutes). For Program B, the expected running time is 20 * 59 = 1180 seconds (approximately 19.67 minutes).\n\n2. Next, we'll calculate the standard deviation of the total running time for each program. The standard deviation of the sum of independent random variables is the square root of the sum of the squares of their individual standard deviations.

Now, we can approximate the probability that Program A completes in less time than B by comparing the CDFs of their respective normal distributions. Since the normal distribution is symmetric around its mean, we can compare the means directly. The z-score for Program A is (1000 - 1180) / ((14.14 + 35.36) / 2) â‰ˆ -5.13. Using a z-table or a calculator with a normal distribution function, we find that the CDF of the standard normal distribution at z = -5.13 is approximately 0.0000023 (three decimal places).\n\n4. Since the CDF gives the probability that a random variable is less than or equal to a certain value, we can subtract this value from 1 to get the probability that the random variable is greater than that value.

Program B will run 20 algorithms in sequence, with the running time for each algorithm being independent random variables with mean = 52 seconds and variance = 200 seconds$^2$. What is the approximate probability that Program A completes in less time than B? Give an answer to three decimal places.\nTeacher solution: Let $X_A$ be the running time of program A, and $X_B$ be the running time of program B. Using the Central Limit Theorem, we can find the distributions of $X_A$ and $X_B$:\n\n\\[\nX_A \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu = 20 \\cdot 50,\\ \\sigma^2 = 20 \\cdot 100)\n\\]\n\\[\nX_B \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu = 20 \\cdot 52,\\ \\sigma^2 = 20 \\cdot 200)\n\\]\n\nDefine a new random variable $X_{A-B}$, representing the difference in running times between program A and program B. Since the sum or difference between two normal random variables is also normal:\n\n\\[\nX_{A-B} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu = 1000 - 1040,\\ \\sigma^2 = 2000 + 4000)\n\\]\n\\[\nX_{A-B} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(-40,\\ 6000)\n\\]\n\nNote that we subtract the means, but add the variances. This is because subtracting the two normals is the same as transforming $X_B$ into $(-1) \\cdot X_B$, then adding that to $X_A$.\n\nIf program A finishes in less time than program B, then $X_{A-B} < 0$. We can calculate the probability of this as:\n\n\\[\nP(X_{A-B} < 0) = \\Phi\\left( \\frac{0 - (-40)}{\\sqrt{6000}} \\right)\n= \\Phi(0.516) \\approx 0.697\n\\]\nThe Student's Work: To solve this problem, we'll use the concept of the expected value and standard deviation of a sum of independent random variables, and then compare the cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) of the two distributions.\n\n1. First, let's calculate the expected running time for each program. The expected value (mean) of a normally distributed random variable is equal to the sum of the means of its independent components. So, for Program A, the expected running time is 20 * 50 = 1000 seconds (approximately 166.67 minutes). For Program B, the expected running time is 20 * 59 = 1180 seconds (approximately 19.67 minutes).\n\n2. Next, we'll calculate the standard deviation of the total running time for each program. The standard deviation of the sum of independent random variables is the square root of the sum of the squares of their individual standard deviations. For Program A, the standard deviation is sqrt(20 * 100) = 10 * sqrt(2) â‰ˆ 14.14 seconds. For Program B, the standard deviation is sqrt(20 * 200) = 20 * sqrt(5) â‰ˆ 35.36 seconds.\n\n3. Now, we can approximate the probability that Program A completes in less time than B by comparing the CDFs of their respective normal distributions. Since the normal distribution is symmetric around its mean, we can compare the means directly. The z-score for Program A is (1000 - 1180) / ((14.14 + 35.36) / 2) â‰ˆ -5.13. Using a z-table or a calculator with a normal distribution function, we find that the CDF of the standard normal distribution at z = -5.13 is approximately 0.0000023 (three decimal places).\n\n4. Since the CDF gives the probability that a random variable is less than or equal to a certain value, we can subtract this value from 1 to get the probability that the random variable is greater than that value. So, the approximate probability that Program A completes in less time than B is 1 - 0.0000023 â‰ˆ 0.9999977 (three decimal places).<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

What is the approximate probability that Program A completes in less time than B? Give an answer to three decimal places.\nTeacher solution: Let $X_A$ be the running time of program A, and $X_B$ be the running time of program B. Using the Central Limit Theorem, we can find the distributions of $X_A$ and $X_B$:\n\n\\[\nX_A \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu = 20 \\cdot 50,\\ \\sigma^2 = 20 \\cdot 100)\n\\]\n\\[\nX_B \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu = 20 \\cdot 52,\\ \\sigma^2 = 20 \\cdot 200)\n\\]\n\nDefine a new random variable $X_{A-B}$, representing the difference in running times between program A and program B. Since the sum or difference between two normal random variables is also normal:\n\n\\[\nX_{A-B} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu = 1000 - 1040,\\ \\sigma^2 = 2000 + 4000)\n\\]\n\\[\nX_{A-B} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(-40,\\ 6000)\n\\]\n\nNote that we subtract the means, but add the variances.

We can calculate the probability of this as:\n\n\\[\nP(X_{A-B} < 0) = \\Phi\\left( \\frac{0 - (-40)}{\\sqrt{6000}} \\right)\n= \\Phi(0.516) \\approx 0.697\n\\]\nThe Student's Work: To solve this problem, we will use the concept of expected value and standard deviation for comparing the average running times of Program A and Program B, and then use the Central Limit Theorem to approximate the probability of Program A completing in less time than Program B.\n\n1.

The standard deviation of a Poisson distribution is the square root of its mean: \\[ \\text{Std}(X) = \\sqrt{\\lambda} = \\sqrt{10,000} = 100. \\] Therefore, the standard deviation of the shot noise photons captured in a single standard photo is 100.\nThe Student's Work: To find the standard deviation of the number of photons captured by a pixel during a single photo, we can use the property of the Poisson distribution, which is that the standard deviation (Ïƒ) is equal to the square root of the mean (Î¼) for this distribution.\n\nGiven that the mean number of photons hitting the pixel per microsecond is 10 photons (Î¼ = 10), the standard deviation Ïƒ will be the square root of 10, which is approximately 3.1622776601683795 (rounded to 7 decimal places).\n\nSo, the standard deviation of the number of photons captured by a pixel during a single 1000 Î¼s photo shot is approximately 3.16 photons. This value represents the average deviation of the actual number of photons captured from the mean number of photons captured per microsecond (10 photons) over the entire 1000 Î¼s photo shot.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

You take a course of antibiotics. The probability that bacteria with the mutation survive is 20%. The probability that bacteria without the mutation survive is 1%. What is the probability that a randomly chosen bacterium survives the antibiotics?\nTeacher solution: Let $E$ be the event that a bacterium survives. Let $M$ be the event that a bacterium has the mutation. By the Law of Total Probability (LOTP): \\[ P(E) = P(E \\text{ and } M) + P(E \\text{ and } M^C) \\] Applying the Chain Rule: \\[ P(E) = P(E|M)P(M) + P(E|M^C)P(M^C) \\] Substituting the given values: \\[ P(E) = 0.20 \\cdot 0.10 + 0.01 \\cdot 0.90 \\] \\[ P(E) = 0.029 \\] Therefore, the probability that a randomly chosen bacterium survives the antibiotics is 0.029.\nThe Student's Work: To solve this problem, we'll use the concept of weighted averages. First, let's define the probabilities and the survival rates for bacteria with and without the mutation:\n\n- P(Mutation) = 0.10 (10% of bacteria have the mutation)\n- P(No Mutation) = 1 - P(Mutation) = 0.90 (90% of bacteria do not have the mutation)\n- Survival rate for bacteria with the mutation = 0.20 (20%)\n- Survival rate for bacteria without the mutation = 0.01 (1%)\n\nNow, we can calculate the expected survival rate for a randomly chosen bacterium by multiplying each survival rate by its respective probability and then summing the results:\n\nExpected Survival Rate = P(Mutation) * Survival rate for bacteria with the mutation + P(No Mutation) * Survival rate for bacteria without the mutation\nExpected Survival Rate = 0.10 * 0.20 + 0.90 * 0.01 = 0.02 + 0.009 = 0.029 or 2.9%\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly chosen bacterium survives the antibiotics is approximately 2.9%.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
        "infer_feedback": "The student's solution is correct.\n\nHowever, there are some issues to address:\n\n1. You're using the term \"weighted averages,\" which is a misleading concept in this context. You should use the Law of Total Probability (LOTP) or the Chain Rule for a more accurate explanation.\n2. In the equation, you're missing the variable names and comments to explain each step. For example, you could label the variables (e.g., p(M) for P(Mutation)) and add comments to describe the calculations.\n3. The statement \"2.9%\" should be in decimal form as well, so it remains consistent with the rest of the solution."

So, to place the second cell, we have 9 available spots where it can be placed, but each of those spots has 8 adjacent free spots for subsequent cells. This means we have 9*8 = 72 ways to place the second cell.\n\nContinuing this pattern, for the third cell, we have 8 available spots with 7 adjacent free spots, so 8*7 = 56 ways to place it. For the fourth cell, we have 7 available spots with 6 adjacent free spots, so 7*6 = 42 ways to place it.\n\nWe can continue this pattern until we reach the ninth cell, which can be placed in a single spot with no adjacent free spots.\n\nTo find the total number of unique rectangles that can be fit in the 10x9 grid, we add up the number of ways to place each cell:\n\n90 (first cell) + 72 (second cell) + 56 (third cell) + 42 (fourth cell) + ... + 1 (ninth cell)\n\nThis is an arithmetic series with the first term (a) equal to 90, the last term (l) equal to 1, and a common difference (d) of -18.

Rectangles can be any size as long as they fit within the grid. Please provide a creative solution rather than brute forcing over sizes.\nTeacher solution: We can solve this problem by thinking about how to define the bounds of a rectangle using lines on the grid, instead of enumerating all possible sizes. A 9x9 grid has 9 rows and 9 columns, but to define rectangles we consider the horizontal and vertical lines that separate these rows and columns. There are 10 horizontal lines (including the boundaries at the top and bottom) and 10 vertical lines (including the left and right boundaries). To define a rectangle, we select two distinct horizontal lines (to serve as the top and bottom bounds) and two distinct vertical lines (to serve as the left and right bounds). The intersection of these chosen bounds gives us a unique rectangle. The number of ways to choose 2 lines from 10 is given by the binomial coefficient: \\[ \\binom{10}{2} = \\frac{10 \\cdot 9}{2} = 45. \\] Therefore, the total number of unique rectangles is the product of the number of choices for the horizontal and vertical bounds: \\[ \\text{Total Rectangles} = \\binom{10}{2} \\times \\binom{10}{2} = 45 \\times 45 = 2025. \\] This approach creatively avoids enumerating individual rectangle sizes and instead uses a combinatorial argument based on choosing boundary lines.\nThe Student's Work: To approach this problem creatively, let's consider the number of ways we can place a single cell (1x1 square) in the 10x9 grid. Since a cell can be placed in any of the 10*9 positions, we have 10*9 = 90 ways to place the first cell.\n\nNow, each time we place a cell, we effectively reduce the available space for the next cell(s) by 1 square unit. So, to place the second cell, we have 9 available spots where it can be placed, but each of those spots has 8 adjacent free spots for subsequent cells. This means we have 9*8 = 72 ways to place the second cell.\n\nContinuing this pattern, for the third cell, we have 8 available spots with 7 adjacent free spots, so 8*7 = 56 ways to place it. For the fourth cell, we have 7 available spots with 6 adjacent free spots, so 7*6 = 42 ways to place it.\n\nWe can continue this pattern until we reach the ninth cell, which can be placed in a single spot with no adjacent free spots.\n\nTo find the total number of unique rectangles that can be fit in the 10x9 grid, we add up the number of ways to place each cell:\n\n90 (first cell) + 72 (second cell) + 56 (third cell) + 42 (fourth cell) + ... + 1 (ninth cell)\n\nThis is an arithmetic series with the first term (a) equal to 90, the last term (l) equal to 1, and a common difference (d) of -18. The sum (S) of an arithmetic series can be calculated using the formula S = (n/2)*(2a + (n-1)d), where n is the number of terms. In this case, n = 9, so:\n\nS = (9/2)*(2*90 + (9-1)*-18) = 9*(180 - 138) = 9*42 = 378\n\nSo, there are 378 unique rectangles that can be fit in a 10x9 grid. This solution avoids brute-forcing over sizes by instead considering the number of ways to place each cell in the grid.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Imagine you live in an area with a large general population (e.g. Stanford with 17,000 students). A small subset of the population are friends. What are the chances that you run into at least one friend if you see a handful of people from the population? Assume that seeing each person from the population is equally likely. In this case, the total population is 17,000, you have 150 friends, and you randomly encounter 100 people.\nTeacher solution: The probability that you see at least one friend is approximately 0.5889. \\[ p = \\text{total population} = 17000 \\] \\[ s = \\text{people seen} = 100 \\] \\[ f = \\text{number of friends} = 150 \\]. Since each way of seeing $s$ people is equally likely, we use the equally likely events probability calculation: \\[ P(E) = \\frac{|E|}{|S|} \\] where $S$ is the sample space (all the ways of seeing $s$ people), and $E$ is the event set (all the ways of seeing $s$ people where at least one is a friend). To simplify the problem, we calculate the probability of not seeing any friends and subtract it from 1. Probability that you don't see friends: \\[ P(\\text{not seen}) = \\frac{\\binom{p - f}{s}}{\\binom{p}{s}} \\]. Probability that you see at least one friend: \\[ P(\\text{seen}) = 1 - \\frac{\\binom{p - f}{s}}{\\binom{p}{s}} \\] Numerically, this evaluates to approximately 0.5889.\nThe Student's Work: To solve this problem, we will use the complementary probability method. Instead of calculating the probability of seeing at least one friend, we'll find the probability of not seeing any friends and then subtract that from 1.\n\nFirst, let's find the probability of not seeing any friends among the 100 people we encounter. Since we have 150 friends out of a total population of 17,000, the probability of not seeing a friend is:\n\nP(Not Friend) = (Total Population - Number of Friends) / Total Population = (17,000 - 150) / 17,000 = 0.9941 (approximately)\n\nSince each encounter is independent, the probability of not seeing any friends among the 100 people we encounter is:\n\nP(Not Friend 100 times) = (0.9941)^100 â‰ˆ 0.000000998\n\nNow, we can find the probability of seeing at least one friend by subtracting the above value from 1:\n\nP(See at least one friend) = 1 - P(Not Friend 100 times) = 1 - 0.000000998 â‰ˆ 0.999999002\n\nSo, the probability of having a serendipitous encounter with at least one friend when you randomly encounter 100 people is approximately 0.999999002 or 99.9999%. This means there's a very high chance of running into at least one friend in this scenario.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

You should have used the combination formula for choosing people to not be friends, not just subtracting the number of friends from the total population. \n\n2.

You should have used the formula for the probability of not seeing any friends among 100 people: P(not seen) = (p - f choose s) / (p choose s), then subtracted it from 1."

        "ta_solution": "We can solve this problem by thinking about how to define the bounds of a rectangle using lines on the grid, instead of enumerating all possible sizes. A 9x9 grid has 9 rows and 9 columns, but to define rectangles we consider the horizontal and vertical lines that separate these rows and columns. There are 10 horizontal lines (including the boundaries at the top and bottom) and 10 vertical lines (including the left and right boundaries). To define a rectangle, we select two distinct horizontal lines (to serve as the top and bottom bounds) and two distinct vertical lines (to serve as the left and right bounds). The intersection of these chosen bounds gives us a unique rectangle. The number of ways to choose 2 lines from 10 is given by the binomial coefficient: \\[ \\binom{10}{2} = \\frac{10 \\cdot 9}{2} = 45. \\] Therefore, the total number of unique rectangles is the product of the number of choices for the horizontal and vertical bounds: \\[ \\text{Total Rectangles} = \\binom{10}{2} \\times \\binom{10}{2} = 45 \\times 45 = 2025. \\] This approach creatively avoids enumerating individual rectangle sizes and instead uses a combinatorial argument based on choosing boundary lines.",
        "stu_solution": "To approach this problem creatively, let's consider the following:\n\n1. We can divide the 9x9 grid into smaller 3x3 sub-grids. Each sub-grid can contain a maximum of one rectangle since they are non-overlapping and fit entirely within the sub-grid.\n\n2. In each 3x3 sub-grid, we have 7 possible rectangle sizes (excluding the size of the sub-grid itself):\n   - 1x1, 2x1, 1x2, 2x2, 1x3, 3x1, and 1x2 (since 3x3 is the size of the sub-grid).\n\n3. However, since we are counting unique rectangles across the entire 9x9 grid, we should account for rotations. For example, a 1x2 rectangle is the same as a 2x1 rectangle. So, we need to divide the count by 2 for the 1x2 and 2x1 rectangles.\n\n4. Now, we have 6 unique rectangle sizes (1x1, 2x1, 1x2, 2x2, 1x3, and 3x1) for each sub-grid.\n\n5. Since there are 9 sub-grids in the 9x9 grid, the total number of unique rectangles is 9 * 6 = 54.\n\nHowever, this solution assumes that we can fit a 1x1 rectangle in every cell, which is not possible due to the grid's structure. To account for this, we should subtract the number of cells in the 9x9 grid, which is 9*9 = 81.\n\nSo, the final answer is 54 - 81 = -27. However, since we cannot have a negative number of unique rectangles, it means that our initial assumption about fitting a 1x1 rectangle in every cell was incorrect, and the actual number of unique rectangles is less than 54.\n\nThis problem illustrates that not all rectangles can fit in the 9x9 grid, and a more precise solution would require a case-by-case analysis of each rectangle size and its possible placements within the grid. This would be a brute-force approach, which was not the intended solution for this creative problem.",

Rectangles can be any size as long as they fit within the grid. Please provide a creative solution rather than brute forcing over sizes.\nTeacher solution: We can solve this problem by thinking about how to define the bounds of a rectangle using lines on the grid, instead of enumerating all possible sizes. A 9x9 grid has 9 rows and 9 columns, but to define rectangles we consider the horizontal and vertical lines that separate these rows and columns. There are 10 horizontal lines (including the boundaries at the top and bottom) and 10 vertical lines (including the left and right boundaries). To define a rectangle, we select two distinct horizontal lines (to serve as the top and bottom bounds) and two distinct vertical lines (to serve as the left and right bounds). The intersection of these chosen bounds gives us a unique rectangle. The number of ways to choose 2 lines from 10 is given by the binomial coefficient: \\[ \\binom{10}{2} = \\frac{10 \\cdot 9}{2} = 45. \\] Therefore, the total number of unique rectangles is the product of the number of choices for the horizontal and vertical bounds: \\[ \\text{Total Rectangles} = \\binom{10}{2} \\times \\binom{10}{2} = 45 \\times 45 = 2025. \\] This approach creatively avoids enumerating individual rectangle sizes and instead uses a combinatorial argument based on choosing boundary lines.\nThe Student's Work: To approach this problem creatively, let's consider the following:\n\n1. We can divide the 9x9 grid into smaller 3x3 sub-grids. Each sub-grid can contain a maximum of one rectangle since they are non-overlapping and fit entirely within the sub-grid.\n\n2. In each 3x3 sub-grid, we have 7 possible rectangle sizes (excluding the size of the sub-grid itself):\n   - 1x1, 2x1, 1x2, 2x2, 1x3, 3x1, and 1x2 (since 3x3 is the size of the sub-grid).\n\n3. However, since we are counting unique rectangles across the entire 9x9 grid, we should account for rotations. For example, a 1x2 rectangle is the same as a 2x1 rectangle. So, we need to divide the count by 2 for the 1x2 and 2x1 rectangles.\n\n4. Now, we have 6 unique rectangle sizes (1x1, 2x1, 1x2, 2x2, 1x3, and 3x1) for each sub-grid.\n\n5. Since there are 9 sub-grids in the 9x9 grid, the total number of unique rectangles is 9 * 6 = 54.\n\nHowever, this solution assumes that we can fit a 1x1 rectangle in every cell, which is not possible due to the grid's structure. To account for this, we should subtract the number of cells in the 9x9 grid, which is 9*9 = 81.\n\nSo, the final answer is 54 - 81 = -27. However, since we cannot have a negative number of unique rectangles, it means that our initial assumption about fitting a 1x1 rectangle in every cell was incorrect, and the actual number of unique rectangles is less than 54.\n\nThis problem illustrates that not all rectangles can fit in the 9x9 grid, and a more precise solution would require a case-by-case analysis of each rectangle size and its possible placements within the grid. This would be a brute-force approach, which was not the intended solution for this creative problem.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

You counted rectangle sizes per sub-grid but didn't account for the grid's boundaries correctly.\n3. You subtracted grid cells, but this isn't a correct way to count rectangles.\n\nThink about the grid's lines as boundaries and use combinations to count rectangles."

We can do this by adding the number of ways to choose 3 pairs where all pairs connect different letters (C(25, 3)) and subtracting the number of ways to choose 4 pairs where one pair connects the same letter (C(26, 4)).\n\nThe number of ways to choose 3 pairs where all pairs connect different letters is C(25, 3). The number of ways to choose 4 pairs where one pair connects the same letter is C(26, 4) - C(25, 4).\n\nSo, the number of valid ways to place 3 wires is:\n\nC(26, 3) - [C(25, 3) + C(26, 4) - C(25, 4)]\n\nThis expression represents the number of valid ways to place 3 wires on the Enigma machine.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This means we'll consider the probability of not seeing each friend individually and then multiply these probabilities together.\n\nThe probability of not seeing a specific friend (Friend 1) is 1 - (number of people you meet / total population) since you can't meet more people than the total population.\n\nP(not seeing Friend 1) = 1 - (number of people you meet / 17,000)\n\nAssuming you meet a \"handful\" of people.

Imagine you live in an area with a large general population (e.g. Stanford with 17,000 students). A small subset of the population are friends. What are the chances that you run into at least one friend if you see a handful of people from the population? Assume that seeing each person from the population is equally likely. In this case, the total population is 17,000, you have 150 friends, and you randomly encounter 100 people.\nTeacher solution: The probability that you see at least one friend is approximately 0.5889. \\[ p = \\text{total population} = 17000 \\] \\[ s = \\text{people seen} = 100 \\] \\[ f = \\text{number of friends} = 150 \\]. Since each way of seeing $s$ people is equally likely, we use the equally likely events probability calculation: \\[ P(E) = \\frac{|E|}{|S|} \\] where $S$ is the sample space (all the ways of seeing $s$ people), and $E$ is the event set (all the ways of seeing $s$ people where at least one is a friend). To simplify the problem, we calculate the probability of not seeing any friends and subtract it from 1. Probability that you don't see friends: \\[ P(\\text{not seen}) = \\frac{\\binom{p - f}{s}}{\\binom{p}{s}} \\]. Probability that you see at least one friend: \\[ P(\\text{seen}) = 1 - \\frac{\\binom{p - f}{s}}{\\binom{p}{s}} \\] Numerically, this evaluates to approximately 0.5889.\nThe Student's Work: To solve this problem, we'll use the complementary probability method. Instead of finding the probability of the desired event (seeing at least one friend), we'll find the probability of the complementary event (not seeing any friends) and then subtract it from 1.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the probability of not seeing any friends. This means we'll consider the probability of not seeing each friend individually and then multiply these probabilities together.\n\nThe probability of not seeing a specific friend (Friend 1) is 1 - (number of people you meet / total population) since you can't meet more people than the total population.\n\nP(not seeing Friend 1) = 1 - (number of people you meet / 17,000)\n\nAssuming you meet a \"handful\" of people. Let x be the number of people you meet. So, the probability of not seeing Friend 1 is:\n\nP(not seeing Friend 1) = 1 - (x / 17000)\n\nNow, you have 154 other friends, and for each friend, the probability of not seeing them is the same as the above expression. So, the probability of not seeing all 155 friends is:\n\nP(not seeing all friends) = [1 - (x / 17000)]^155\n\nNow, we'll find the probability of seeing at least one friend, which is the complement of the probability of not seeing any friends:\n\nP(seeing at least one friend) = 1 - P(not seeing all friends)\n\nSo,\n\nP(seeing at least one friend) = 1 - [1 - (x / 17000)]^155\n\nHowever, since we don't know the exact number of people you meet (x), we can't find the exact probability. Instead, we can calculate the probability for different values of x (number of people you meet) and interpret the results.\n\nFor example, if you meet 100 people, the probability of seeing at least one friend is:\n\nP(seeing at least one friend) = 1 - [1 - (100 / 17000)]^155 â‰ˆ 0.8648\n\nThis means that, if you meet 100 people, there's approximately an 86.48% chance that you'll run into at least one friend.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

To understand the probability of any event related to these bacteria, we need to define the events of interest. Let's consider two possible events:\n\n1. Picking a single bacterium randomly from the population:\n\n   Since there are 1,000,000 bacteria in total, the probability of picking any single bacterium is 1 (certainty), as the event of drawing one bacterium from the population is guaranteed to occur if we are allowed to draw one bacterium. However, the probability of picking an infectious bacterium is equal to the fraction of infectious bacteria in the population. Since all bacteria are infectious, this fraction is 1, and so the probability of picking an infectious bacterium is also 1.\n\n2. Picking a specific bacterium from the population:\n\n   In this case, the probability of picking a specific bacterium depends on the number of times we draw bacteria from the population. For example, if we draw bacteria one by one without replacement, the probability of picking a specific bacterium is the fraction of that bacterium in the population. Since we know there are 1,000,000 bacteria, the probability of picking a specific bacterium is 1/1,000,000.\n\nIn summary, the probability of picking an infectious bacterium is 1 (certainty) as all bacteria are infectious. However, the probability of picking a specific bacterium from the population depends on the number of times we draw bacteria and the number of that bacterium in the population.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Rectangles can be any size as long as they fit within the grid. Please provide a creative solution rather than brute forcing over sizes.\nTeacher solution: We can solve this problem by thinking about how to define the bounds of a rectangle using lines on the grid, instead of enumerating all possible sizes. A 9x9 grid has 9 rows and 9 columns, but to define rectangles we consider the horizontal and vertical lines that separate these rows and columns. There are 10 horizontal lines (including the boundaries at the top and bottom) and 10 vertical lines (including the left and right boundaries). To define a rectangle, we select two distinct horizontal lines (to serve as the top and bottom bounds) and two distinct vertical lines (to serve as the left and right bounds). The intersection of these chosen bounds gives us a unique rectangle. The number of ways to choose 2 lines from 10 is given by the binomial coefficient: \\[ \\binom{10}{2} = \\frac{10 \\cdot 9}{2} = 45. \\] Therefore, the total number of unique rectangles is the product of the number of choices for the horizontal and vertical bounds: \\[ \\text{Total Rectangles} = \\binom{10}{2} \\times \\binom{10}{2} = 45 \\times 45 = 2025. \\] This approach creatively avoids enumerating individual rectangle sizes and instead uses a combinatorial argument based on choosing boundary lines.\nThe Student's Work: To solve this problem creatively, let's consider the dimensions of the rectangles.

Assume a day is composed of 8 one hour blocks. Each block has $p = 0.7$ probability of being busy for each person. We assume that whether each block is busy for a person is independent of whether other blocks are busy for them, and also independent of whether that block is busy for other people. Question: Two people are trying to schedule a meeting. What is the probability that there is at least one block of time when they are both free on a given day? Provide an answer to 3 decimal places.\nTeacher solution: Solving this problem requires us to recognize how helpful it is to take the complement a few times. First, since we are looking for the probability that at least one block of time is free for both people, we can simplify our calculations by taking the complement of at least one and instead finding one minus the probability that all blocks of time are busy for at least one of the two people.P(1+ time free for both) = 1 - P(all times busy)= 1 - P(block 1 busy âˆ© block 2 busy âˆ© ... âˆ© block 8 busy)= 1 - P(a block is busy for at least one person)^8 We break down the probability of and above by noting that independence between blocks lets us multiply together the probabilities for the individual blocks being busy. Now we have another at least event. At least one person being busy means exactly one person is busy, or both of them are busy. You could use inclusion-exclusion here (probability of or without mutual exclusion, where you need to subtract the intersection), but we could also just take the complement again:= 1 - P(a block is busy for at least one person)^8= 1 - (1 - P(block is free for both people))^8= 1 - (1 - P(person 1 free âˆ© person 2 free))^8= 1 - (1 - P(person is free for one block)^2)^8= 1 - (1 - (1 - 0.7)^2)^8. Above, we used independence between people to break down a probability of and into the product of the probability that one person is free for a particular block, and finally, we plugged in the complement of the probability that a person is busy for one block.\nThe Student's Work: To solve this problem, we'll use the complementary probability method. Instead of finding the probability that both people are free in at least one block, we'll find the probability that they are both busy in all blocks, and then subtract that from 1.\n\nFirst, let's find the probability that both people are busy in a single block. Since the events are independent, we can multiply the probabilities:\n\nP(busy for both) = P(person 1 is busy) * P(person 2 is busy) = 0.7 * 0.7 = 0.49\n\nSince there are 8 one-hour blocks in a day, the probability that both people are busy in all 8 blocks is:\n\nP(both busy in all blocks) = (0.49)^8 â‰ˆ 0.0033\n\nNow, we can find the probability that there is at least one block when they are both free:\n\nP(at least one free block) = 1 - P(both busy in all blocks) = 1 - 0.0033 â‰ˆ 0.9967\n\nSo, the probability that there is at least one block of time when they can meet, to 3 decimal places, is approximately 0.997.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Imagine you live in an area with a large general population (e.g. Stanford with 17,000 students). A small subset of the population are friends. What are the chances that you run into at least one friend if you see a handful of people from the population? Assume that seeing each person from the population is equally likely. In this case, the total population is 17,000, you have 150 friends, and you randomly encounter 100 people.\nTeacher solution: The probability that you see at least one friend is approximately 0.5889. \\[ p = \\text{total population} = 17000 \\] \\[ s = \\text{people seen} = 100 \\] \\[ f = \\text{number of friends} = 150 \\]. Since each way of seeing $s$ people is equally likely, we use the equally likely events probability calculation: \\[ P(E) = \\frac{|E|}{|S|} \\] where $S$ is the sample space (all the ways of seeing $s$ people), and $E$ is the event set (all the ways of seeing $s$ people where at least one is a friend). To simplify the problem, we calculate the probability of not seeing any friends and subtract it from 1. Probability that you don't see friends: \\[ P(\\text{not seen}) = \\frac{\\binom{p - f}{s}}{\\binom{p}{s}} \\]. Probability that you see at least one friend: \\[ P(\\text{seen}) = 1 - \\frac{\\binom{p - f}{s}}{\\binom{p}{s}} \\] Numerically, this evaluates to approximately 0.5889.\nThe Student's Work: To solve this problem, we will use the complementary probability method. Instead of finding the probability of seeing at least one friend, we'll find the probability of not seeing any friends and then subtract that from 1.\n\n1. First, let's find the probability of not seeing a friend when encountering one person. Since there are 148 friends out of a total population of 17,000, the probability of not seeing a friend is:\n\n   P(not seeing a friend) = 1 - P(seeing a friend)\n   = 1 - (Number of friends / Total population)\n   = 1 - (148 / 17000)\n   = 0.99177778 (rounded to 7 decimal places)\n\n2. Now, we have 100 encounters with people. To find the probability of not seeing any friends in 100 encounters, we'll use the formula for the binomial probability:\n\n   P(not seeing any friends in 100 encounters) = (P(not seeing a friend))^100\n   = (0.99177778)^100\n   = 0.000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Calculate the number of combinations C(100, 0):\n\nC(100, 0) = 100! / (0! * 100!) = 1\n\n4. Calculate the probability of not encountering a friend:\n\nP(not friend) = (16,850 / 17,000)^100\nP(not friend) â‰ˆ 0.367879441\n\n5. Now, find the complementary probability of encountering at least one friend:\n\nP(at least one friend) = 1 - P(not friend)\nP(at least one friend) â‰ˆ 1 - 0.367879441\nP(at least one friend) â‰ˆ 0.632120559\n\nSo, the probability of having at least one serendipitous encounter with a friend when you see 100 people is approximately 0.6321 or 63.21%.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
        "infer_feedback": "Your solution is mostly correct.\n\nYou're on the right track with the complementary probability approach, but your calculation for the probability of not encountering any friends has an error.\n\nYou used the binomial probability formula with p as the probability of not encountering a friend, which is incorrect. Instead, p should be the probability of encountering a non-friend, which is 16,850 / 17,000.\n\nRecalculate that and you'll get the correct answer."

There are 10 horizontal lines (including the boundaries at the top and bottom) and 10 vertical lines (including the left and right boundaries).

        "stu_solution": "To solve this problem creatively, let's approach it in a systematic manner by considering the dimensions of the rectangles. We can start by finding the maximum and minimum possible dimensions of the rectangles that can fit within the 9x10 grid.\n\n1. Minimum dimensions: The smallest rectangle that can fit in the grid will be a 1x1 square, but since we want unique rectangles, we'll consider the smallest rectangle that has dimensions greater than 1x1. One such example is a 1x2 rectangle.\n\n2. Maximum dimensions: The largest rectangle that can fit in the grid would be a 9x10 rectangle, but since we don't want the entire grid to be a single rectangle, we'll consider the largest rectangle that has dimensions less than the grid size.

Since there are 9 slots in the horizontal direction and 10 slots in the vertical direction, the total number of slots is 9*10 = 90.\n\nFor rectangles with dimensions greater than 2x2, we can place them by considering the number of ways to choose the starting position (left-top corner) and the number of ways to choose the dimensions of the rectangle.\n\nLet's denote the number of unique rectangles with dimensions greater than 2x2 as R.

We want to find P(Program B's running time > Program A's running time), so we want to find P(Program B's running time > 1060 seconds).\n\n   P(Program B's running time > 1060) = 1 - P(Program B's running time â‰¤ 1060) = 1 - Î¦((1060 - 954) / 62.76) = 1 - Î¦(1.59) â‰ˆ 0.05868.\n\n   Since the probability is less than 0.1, we can approximate the answer to three decimal places as 0.059.

You take a course of antibiotics. The probability that bacteria with the mutation survive is 20%. The probability that bacteria without the mutation survive is 1%. What is the probability that a randomly chosen bacterium survives the antibiotics?\nTeacher solution: Let $E$ be the event that a bacterium survives. Let $M$ be the event that a bacterium has the mutation. By the Law of Total Probability (LOTP): \\[ P(E) = P(E \\text{ and } M) + P(E \\text{ and } M^C) \\] Applying the Chain Rule: \\[ P(E) = P(E|M)P(M) + P(E|M^C)P(M^C) \\] Substituting the given values: \\[ P(E) = 0.20 \\cdot 0.10 + 0.01 \\cdot 0.90 \\] \\[ P(E) = 0.029 \\] Therefore, the probability that a randomly chosen bacterium survives the antibiotics is 0.029.\nThe Student's Work: To find the probability that a randomly chosen bacterium survives the antibiotics, we first need to find the probability of choosing a bacterium with the mutation and then find the probability of that bacterium surviving, as well as the probability of choosing a bacterium without the mutation and finding it surviving. We can then add these two probabilities together, as they are mutually exclusive events (either the bacterium has the mutation or it doesn't).\n\nLet's denote the probability of choosing a bacterium with the mutation as P(M), the probability of survival for bacteria with the mutation as S(M), and the probability of choosing a bacterium without the mutation as P(NM). The probability of survival for bacteria without the mutation is S(NM).\n\nGiven that 10% of the bacteria have the mutation, we have:\n\nP(M) = 0.1\n\nSince 20% of bacteria with the mutation survive, we have:\n\nS(M) = 0.2\n\nSince 90% of the bacteria do not have the mutation, we have:\n\nP(NM) = 0.9\n\nSince only 1% of bacteria without the mutation survive, we have:\n\nS(NM) = 0.01\n\nNow we can calculate the probability of choosing a bacterium and finding it surviving:\n\nP(surviving) = P(M) * S(M) + P(NM) * S(NM)\n\nP(surviving) = (0.1 * 0.2) + (0.9 * 0.01)\n\nP(surviving) = 0.02 + 0.009\n\nP(surviving) = 0.029\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly chosen bacterium survives the antibiotics is approximately 2.9%.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The probability that a Netflix user likes a movie $T_i$ from the 'Tearjerker' genre is given by: Given that they like the Tearjerker genre, $p_i = 0.4$. Given that they do not like the Tearjerker genre, $q_i = 0.9$. 60% of Netflix users like the Tearjerker genre.

The formula for the variance of the mean is ÏƒÂ²/n, where n is the number of grades being averaged. In this case, n = 5. So, the variance of the mean of five grades would be ÏƒÂ²/5.\n\nHowever, we don't have the actual data, so we can't calculate the exact variance.

Program B will run 20 algorithms in sequence, with the running time for each algorithm being independent random variables with mean = 52 seconds and variance = 200 seconds$^2$. What is the approximate probability that Program A completes in less time than B? Give an answer to three decimal places.\nTeacher solution: Let $X_A$ be the running time of program A, and $X_B$ be the running time of program B. Using the Central Limit Theorem, we can find the distributions of $X_A$ and $X_B$:\n\n\\[\nX_A \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu = 20 \\cdot 50,\\ \\sigma^2 = 20 \\cdot 100)\n\\]\n\\[\nX_B \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu = 20 \\cdot 52,\\ \\sigma^2 = 20 \\cdot 200)\n\\]\n\nDefine a new random variable $X_{A-B}$, representing the difference in running times between program A and program B. Since the sum or difference between two normal random variables is also normal:\n\n\\[\nX_{A-B} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu = 1000 - 1040,\\ \\sigma^2 = 2000 + 4000)\n\\]\n\\[\nX_{A-B} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(-40,\\ 6000)\n\\]\n\nNote that we subtract the means, but add the variances. This is because subtracting the two normals is the same as transforming $X_B$ into $(-1) \\cdot X_B$, then adding that to $X_A$.\n\nIf program A finishes in less time than program B, then $X_{A-B} < 0$. We can calculate the probability of this as:\n\n\\[\nP(X_{A-B} < 0) = \\Phi\\left( \\frac{0 - (-40)}{\\sqrt{6000}} \\right)\n= \\Phi(0.516) \\approx 0.697\n\\]\nThe Student's Work: To solve this problem, we'll first find the expected running time for each algorithm in both Program A and Program B, and then find the distribution of the total running time for each program. After that, we can compare the expected total running times and use the cumulative distribution function (CDF) to find the probability that Program A completes in less time than B.\n\n1. Expected running time for each algorithm in Program A:\n   Mean = 50 seconds\n   So, the expected running time for one algorithm in Program A is 50 seconds.\n\n2. Expected running time for each algorithm in Program B:\n   Mean = 52 seconds\n   So, the expected running time for one algorithm in Program B is 52 seconds.\n\n3. Total running time for each program:\n   Program A runs 1 algorithm, so the total running time is 50 seconds.\n   Program B runs 20 algorithms, so the total running time is 20 * 52 = 1040 seconds (17 minutes and 0 seconds).\n\n4. Variance for each algorithm:\n   Program A: variance = 100 seconds^2\n   Program B: variance = 200 seconds^2\n\n5. Total variance for each program:\n   Program A: total variance = 100 seconds^2 (since it runs only 1 algorithm)\n   Program B: total variance = 200 * 20 = 4000 seconds^2 (or 1 hour and 40 minutes of variance)\n\n6. Standard deviation for each algorithm:\n   Program A: standard deviation = sqrt(100) â‰ˆ 10 seconds\n   Program B: standard deviation = sqrt(4000) â‰ˆ 63.24 seconds\n\n7. Standard deviation for total running time for each program:\n   Program A: total standard deviation = 10 seconds (since it runs only 1 algorithm)\n   Program B: total standard deviation = sqrt(4000) * sqrt(20) â‰ˆ 208.68 seconds (or 3 minutes and 29 seconds)\n\n8. Approximate distribution of total running time for each program:\n   Since the running times are normally distributed, the total running time for each program will also be normally distributed. We can use the z-score formula to find the approximate z-scores for the expected total running times:\n\n   Z-score for Program A = (expected running time - mean) / standard deviation\n   Z-score for Program A = (50 - 50) / 10 = 0\n\n   Z-score for Program B = (expected running time - mean) / standard deviation\n   Z-score for Program B = (1040 - 50) / 208.68 â‰ˆ 4.96\n\n   Now, we can use a z-table to find the cumulative probability for each z-score:\n   P(Z <= 0) for Program A = 0.5\n   P(Z <= 4.96) for Program B â‰ˆ 0.9999997 (nearly certain)\n\n9. Probability that Program A completes in less time than B:\n   P(Program A completes in less time than B) = P(Z <= 0 for Program A) - P(Z <= 4.96 for Program B)\n   P(Program A completes in less time than B) = 0.5 - 0.9999997 â‰ˆ 0.0000003\n\nSo, the approximate probability that Program A completes in less time than B is 0.000, which is essentially zero. It is almost certain that Program B will complete in less time than Program A.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Note that it is possible to get two triangles: after you pick the first triangle, you put it back into the set of shapes and it can be chosen again.\nTeacher solution: The sample space consists of 49 possible outcomes because there are 7 choices for the first shape and 7 choices for the second shape (since selection is with replacement). \\[ |S| = 7 \\times 7 = 49 \\] Let $E$ be the event where the two shapes are the same. There are two ways this can happen: (1) both shapes are squares, or (2) both shapes are triangles. Define $A$ as the event of selecting two squares, and $B$ as the event of selecting two triangles. These two events are mutually exclusive. The number of ways to choose two squares is \\[ |A| = 6 \\times 6 = 36 \\] since there are 6 squares and we choose one twice (with replacement). The number of ways to choose two triangles is \\[ |B| = 1 \\times 1 = 1 \\] since there is only one triangle. Therefore, the probability of selecting two matching shapes is \\[ P(\\text{same}) = \\frac{|E|}{|S|} = \\frac{|A| + |B|}{|S|} = \\frac{36 + 1}{49} = \\frac{37}{49}. \\]\nThe Student's Work: To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of choosing the same shape twice when drawing two shapes with replacement from the set.\n\nFirst, let's determine the total number of possible outcomes. There are 7 shapes (6 squares and 1 triangle), so the total number of outcomes is 7^2 = 49.\n\nNext, let's determine the number of favorable outcomes, which is the number of ways to choose two identical shapes. For squares, there are 6 of them, so there are 6 ways to choose two squares. Similarly, there is 1 triangle, so there is 1 way to choose two triangles. Since we're considering the same shape twice, the number of ways to choose two squares is the same as the number of ways to choose two triangles. So, the total number of favorable outcomes is 6 + 1 = 7.\n\nNow, we can calculate the probability by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes:\n\nProbability = Favorable Outcomes / Total Outcomes = 7 / 49\n\nSo, the probability of choosing two identical shapes (either two squares or two triangles) is 7/49.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

        "ta_solution": "We can solve this problem by thinking about how to define the bounds of a rectangle using lines on the grid, instead of enumerating all possible sizes. A 9x9 grid has 9 rows and 9 columns, but to define rectangles we consider the horizontal and vertical lines that separate these rows and columns. There are 10 horizontal lines (including the boundaries at the top and bottom) and 10 vertical lines (including the left and right boundaries). To define a rectangle, we select two distinct horizontal lines (to serve as the top and bottom bounds) and two distinct vertical lines (to serve as the left and right bounds). The intersection of these chosen bounds gives us a unique rectangle. The number of ways to choose 2 lines from 10 is given by the binomial coefficient: \\[ \\binom{10}{2} = \\frac{10 \\cdot 9}{2} = 45. \\] Therefore, the total number of unique rectangles is the product of the number of choices for the horizontal and vertical bounds: \\[ \\text{Total Rectangles} = \\binom{10}{2} \\times \\binom{10}{2} = 45 \\times 45 = 2025. \\] This approach creatively avoids enumerating individual rectangle sizes and instead uses a combinatorial argument based on choosing boundary lines.",
        "stu_solution": "To approach this problem creatively, let's consider the following:\n\n1. We can start by placing a single 1x1 square at any position in the grid, which gives us 9 possible locations.\n\n2. Next, we can place a 1x2 rectangle (a vertical line segment) in any of the 9 columns of the grid, with its starting point in any of the 8 rows (excluding the top row, as we already have a 1x1 square there). This gives us 72 possible positions (9 columns * 8 rows).\n\n3. Similarly, we can place a 1x3 rectangle (a horizontal line segment) in any of the 9 rows of the grid, with its starting point in any of the 8 columns (excluding the leftmost column, as we already have a 1x1 square there). This gives us 72 possible positions as well (9 rows * 8 columns).\n\n4. For 2x2 squares, there are 9 possible positions in the grid where the center of the square can be placed (any of the 9 cells not occupied by the 1x1 squares, 1x2 vertical lines, or 1x3 horizontal lines). For each of these positions, there are 4 possible orientations (two for horizontal and two for vertical). So, we have 36 possible 2x2 squares (9 positions * 4 orientations).\n\n5. For larger rectangles, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. If we add the number of smaller rectangles (1x1, 1x2, 1x3, and 2x2) and subtract the number of overlaps, we get the total number of unique rectangles.\n\n6. To calculate the number of overlaps, we can consider the following:\n\n   - For each 1x2 vertical line, there are 7 other 1x2 vertical lines that overlap with it. However, each of these overlaps is counted twice (once for each line), so we divide the total number of 1x2 vertical lines by 2 to get the actual number of unique overlaps. This gives us 36 overlaps (72 / 2).\n\n   - For each 1x3 horizontal line, there are 8 other 1x3 horizontal lines that overlap with it. Similarly, each of these overlaps is counted twice, so we divide the total number of 1x3 horizontal lines by 2 to get the actual number of unique overlaps. This gives us 48 overlaps (72 / 2).\n\n   - For each 2x2 square, there are 4 smaller rectangles (1x1, 1x2, 1x3, and another 2x2) that overlap with it. However, each of these overlaps is counted multiple times, so we need to subtract the number of these smaller rectangles from the number of 2x2 squares to avoid double-counting. This gives us 36 - (9 + 72 + 72 + 36) = -144, which is not possible, as the number of rectangles cannot be negative.\n\n   - This indicates that our approach is incorrect, as we are overcounting the overlaps. To correct this, we need to consider that a larger rectangle can overlap with multiple smaller rectangles, but a smaller rectangle can only overlap with one larger rectangle. So, we should subtract the number of smaller rectangles that are completely covered by a larger rectangle, instead of subtracting the number of overlaps.\n\n   - To do this, we can subtract the number of 1x1 squares that are completely covered by 2x2 squares (9), the number of 1x2 vertical lines that are completely covered by 2x2 squares (18), and the number of 1x3 horizontal lines that are completely covered by 2x2 squares (18). This gives us 45 overlaps that should be subtracted from the number of 2x2 squares.\n\n   - With these corrections, the total number of unique rectangles can be calculated as follows:\n     Total rectangles = 9 (1x1 squares) + 72 (1x2 vertical lines) + 72 (1x3 horizontal lines) + 36 (2x2 squares) - 45 (overlaps) = 150\n\nSo, there are 150 unique rectangles that can be fitted in a 9x9 grid.",

The class used peer assessment to evaluate student work. In the class, each student has their work evaluated by 5 peers, and every student is asked to evaluate 6 assignments: five peers and one control assignment (graders were unaware of which assignment was the control). All 10,000 students evaluated the same control assignment, and the scores they gave are in the file peerGrades.csv.\n\nWould you use the mean or the median of 5 peer grades to assign scores in the online version of Stanford's HCI class? Explain why. You may use simulations to solve any part of this question. Hint: it might help to visualize the scores in peerGrades.csv. In order to make your decision compute the statistics in part a) and b).\n\na) Mean of Grades\nStudents could be given a final score which is the mean of the 5 grades given by their peers. Imagine the control experiment had only received 5 peer-grades. What is the variance of the mean of those five grades? Succinctly describe how you calculated your answer.\n\nb) Median of Grades\nStudents could be given a final score which is the median of the 5 grades given by their peers. Imagine the control experiment had only received 5 peer-grades. What is the variance of the median grade that the control experiment would have been given? Succinctly describe how you calculated your answer. Enter your estimate of the variance to 1 decimal place as your numeric answer.\nTeacher solution: First, here's a simple way of loading in the data from the file:\n\n```python\nwith open(filepath, 'r') as f:\n    grades = [int(line) for line in f]\n```\n\nWe want to simulate the process of taking the mean of 5 grades, over and over, so that we can get an estimate of how much that mean-of-5 varies, depending on the spread of the values in the overall dataset. This is analogous to bootstrapping! To determine this \"variance of the mean,\" we just sample 5 grades, take the mean, and repeat, and then take the variance of all of those means.\n\n```python\nmeans = []\nfor i in range(10000):\n    sample = np.random.choice(grades, 5, replace=True)\n    means.append(np.mean(sample))\n\nprint(np.var(means))\n```\n\nThe variance of the mean is 101.26. Note that with fewer iterations for the for loop, you might get a number that varies run-to-run.\n\nFor part b, we repeat this process, but take the median instead of the mean inside the for loop. The variance of the median is 56.021.\n\nYou could conclude that the median is better simply because it has a lower variance. A better argument can be made by looking at the histogram of grades given to the control experiment, which shows that there are extreme outliers in the distribution that would skew the mean, but not the median.\nThe Student's Work: a) Mean of Grades:\nTo calculate the variance of the mean of five grades, we first need to understand that the variance of a set of data is the average of the squared differences from the mean. In this case, we're dealing with five grades, each of which has its own variance.\n\nLet's denote the five grades as X1, X2, X3, X4, X5. The mean of these grades (M) is (X1 + X2 + X3 + X4 + X5) / 5.\n\nThe variance of a single grade (ÏƒÂ²) is unknown, but we can assume it's constant for all grades since they are all grades from the same distribution.\n\nThe variance of the mean (ÏƒÂ²_M) is given by the formula:\n\nÏƒÂ²_M = ÏƒÂ² / n, where n is the number of grades.\n\nSince we don't know the exact value of ÏƒÂ², we can't provide a specific numerical value for the variance of the mean. However, we can express it in terms of the variance of a single grade:\n\nÏƒÂ²_M = ÏƒÂ² / 5\n\nb) Median of Grades:\nThe median of a set of data is the middle value when the data is sorted in ascending order. In this case, we're dealing with five grades.\n\nSince the median is a single value, it doesn't have a variance. The variance is a measure of the spread of a distribution, and a single value doesn't have a spread. So, the variance of the median grade is undefined.\n\nHowever, if we were to consider the variation in the median grades among different students, we could potentially calculate a measure of dispersion, such as the range or interquartile range, but not the variance.\n\nIn this question, we're asked to calculate the variance of the median grade that the control experiment would have been given. Since the median is a single value and doesn't have a variance, the answer to this question is undefined.\n\nIn summary, the variance of the mean of five grades is ÏƒÂ² / 5, where ÏƒÂ² is the variance of a single grade. The variance of the median grade is undefined. The variance of the median grade that the control experiment would have been given is also undefined.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Assume that shot noise photons land on a particular pixel at a rate of 10 photons per microsecond, and the number of photons hitting the pixel follows a Poisson distribution.\nTeacher solution: The number of shot noise photons hitting a pixel in a standard photo can be modeled as a Poisson random variable: \\[ X \\sim \\text{Poi}(\\lambda = 10,000) \\] where $\\lambda = 10 \\times 1000 = 10,000$, since the rate is 10 photons per microsecond and the duration is 1000 microseconds. The standard deviation of a Poisson distribution is the square root of its mean: \\[ \\text{Std}(X) = \\sqrt{\\lambda} = \\sqrt{10,000} = 100. \\] Therefore, the standard deviation of the shot noise photons captured in a single standard photo is 100.\nThe Student's Work: To solve problems involving the Poisson distribution, we need to know three key parameters:\n\n1. The average rate (Î») at which events occur (in this case, the average number of photons hitting the pixel per unit time).\n2. The time interval (T) over which we are observing the events.\n3. The number of trials (n) we are interested in, which in this case is the number of time intervals (or pixels) we are considering.\n\nGiven that the number of photons hitting the pixel follows a Poisson distribution, we can use the formula for the Poisson probability mass function (PMF) to find the probability of a certain number of photons hitting a pixel:\n\nP(X=k) = (e^(-Î») * Î»^k) / k!\n\nwhere:\n- P(X=k) is the probability of k photons hitting the pixel,\n- e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828),\n- Î» is the average rate of photons hitting the pixel per unit time,\n- k is the number of photons we are considering,\n- ! denotes the factorial function.\n\nHowever, without specific values for Î», T, and n, I can't provide a concrete solution to the problem. To find the solution, you should plug in the appropriate values for these parameters and calculate the probabilities for the desired number of photons hitting each pixel.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

You didn't use the given rate and duration to calculate Î».\n3. You also didn't calculate the standard deviation as required by the problem."
