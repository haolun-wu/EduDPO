            "content": "[[ ## question_text ## ]]\nImagine you have a population of 1 million infectious bacteria in your gut, 10% of which have a mutation that makes them slightly more resistant to antibiotics. You take a course of antibiotics. The probability that bacteria with the mutation survive is 20%. The probability that bacteria without the mutation survive is 1%. What is the probability that a randomly chosen bacterium survives the antibiotics?\n\n[[ ## ta_solution ## ]]\nLet $E$ be the event that a bacterium survives. Let $M$ be the event that a bacterium has the mutation. By the Law of Total Probability (LOTP): \\[ P(E) = P(E \\text{ and } M) + P(E \\text{ and } M^C) \\] Applying the Chain Rule: \\[ P(E) = P(E|M)P(M) + P(E|M^C)P(M^C) \\] Substituting the given values: \\[ P(E) = 0.20 \\cdot 0.10 + 0.01 \\cdot 0.90 \\] \\[ P(E) = 0.029 \\] Therefore, the probability that a randomly chosen bacterium survives the antibiotics is 0.029.\n\n[[ ## stu_solution ## ]]\nTo solve this problem, we can use the concept of conditional probability.\n\nLet A be the event that a bacterium has the mutation, and B be the event that the bacterium survives the antibiotics. We want to find P(B).\n\nFirst, we find the probabilities of the events A and B happening separately:\n\nP(A) = Number of bacteria with the mutation \/ Total number of bacteria = 100,000 \/ 1,000,000 = 0.1\nP(B|A) = Survival probability of bacteria with the mutation = 0.2\n\nP(~A) = Number of bacteria without the mutation \/ Total number of bacteria = 900,000 \/ 1,000,000 = 0.9\nP(B|~A) = Survival probability of bacteria without the mutation = 0.01\n\nNow, we use the formula for conditional probability:\n\nP(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nP(B) = (0.2 * 0.1) + (0.01 * 0.9) = 0.02 + 0.009 = 0.029\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly chosen bacterium survives the antibiotics is approximately 0.029 or 2.9%.\n\n[[ ## feedback ## ]]\nGreat job! You've correctly applied the concept of conditional probability and used the Law of Total Probability to solve the problem. Your explanation is clear and well-structured. Keep up the good work!\n\nRespond with the corresponding output fields, starting with the field `[[ ## reasoning ## ]]`, then `[[ ## asessment ## ]]` (must be formatted as a valid Python dict[str, bool]), and then ending with the marker for `[[ ## completed ## ]]`.",
